Sec. 67-2 General approval criteria for preliminary and final plat
I.
Preliminary plat criteria.
The preliminary plat phase of the subdivision review process is an evaluation of the design and engineering aspects of a proposed subdivision as well as any relevant conceptual issues. All the technical aspects of the physical development of the proposed site will be evaluated to determine their compliance with required design, planning, performance and engineering standards. To approve a preliminary plat, the decision-making body shall review the subdivision for compliance with the general approval criteria stated in section 66-16.
II.
Final plat criteria
. The final phase of the review process consists of the review of the application for the final plat. Final plat submittals shall meet all the following criteria:

Sec. 67-3 Major subdivisions
I.
Applicability.
The major subdivision procedures shall be applicable to all land divisions into four (4) or more lots.
II.
Overview of necessary applications.
A major subdivision is subject to a sketch plan review by the PC and a preliminary plat review by the board, followed by the administrative review of the final plat. Each step is a distinct process involving the submittal of an application, an application fee, required plans and reports, referrals of the proposal to other agencies, staff analysis and public hearings. At each step of the process, the design and engineering detail increases in order to relieve the applicant from major and potentially unnecessary expenses in situations that may require a redesign and a revision of expensive engineering or planning reports. A general description of these steps is outlined below. Approval at any step in the process does not ensure approval at the next step.
Figure 67-3 A: Overview of Major Subdivision Procedures provides an overview of the application steps that apply to the review major land use permits.
III.
Preliminary plat procedures.
Figure 67-3 B: Summary of Preliminary Plat Procedures identifies the application steps that apply to the review of a preliminary plat.
IV.
Requirements for phased development.
A.
Preliminary plats consistent with phasing plans. Review and approval of a phasing plan in conjunction with a sketch plan or conceptual development plan shall be required for any subdivision proposed in phases. Each preliminary plat shall be consistent with the phasing plan approved under such sketch plan or conceptual development plan.
B.
Phased final plats. The preliminary plat may provide for phasing of final plat approvals as determined by the director based upon consideration of the design, size, and complexity of the subdivision and associated improvements. Such phasing of the final plats shall not require the prior approval of a sketch plan or conceptual development plan; however, it shall require a phasing plan be submitted and approved as part of the preliminary plat application. The locations and schedule of phases shall be clearly stated and indicated on the plat and in supporting documentation. The improvements and drainage plans and specifications shall also address in detail the subdivision improvements to be constructed and completed in association with each phase.
V.
Effect of approval.
A.
No vested rights. Preliminary plats shall not be construed to be site specific development plans.
B.
Preliminary plat approval period. Preliminary plat approval is valid for one (1) year after approval by the board. An approved preliminary plat shall be of no further force and effect if the final plat application for the subdivision is not submitted within one (1) year of the date of the preliminary plat's approval by the decision-making body.
C.
Approval period for preliminary plat for phased final plats. If the approved preliminary plat provides for phasing of final plats, and a final plat application for any phase of a subdivision is not submitted within the time specified in the approved phasing plan, then the preliminary plat approval shall be of no further force or effect. For phased subdivisions, an approved final plat for any phase of the preliminary plat shall extend the life of the remaining preliminary plat according to the approved phasing plan, or if not specified in an approved phasing plan, for an additional one (1) year from the date the final plat is approved. If successive final plats are not submitted within this one (1) year period, or within the period specified in an approved phasing plan, then the preliminary plat approval shall be of no further force or effect for those portions of the subject property not covered by an approved final plat.

Applicability. Notwithstanding any applicableÂ section in this code, this subsection II on naming applies to applications for all land use permits and any owner who seeks to change an existing name.
B.
Standards.
1.
Proposed subdivision names shall not duplicate existing subdivision names within the county. Nor shall subdivision names be the reversal or variation of an existing name that, in the opinion of the director, may unnecessarily contribute to confusion for emergency responders.
2.
Naming of streets and addressing. Consistent and appropriate street naming and addressing procedures and standards contribute to the planned and orderly development of the county in a way that assists first responders in maintaining the public health, safety and general welfare of persons within the county. Any person who creates a new street, wants to name or re-name an existing street or requests the assignment of a new or revised address shall meet the minimum standards set forth in the naming and addressing policy and guidance documents made available by the La Plata County GIS Department, which policy and guidance documents are intended to implement these standards and which may be amended by such department to comport to current industry standards.
III.
Lot design and density standards.
A.
Topography. To the maximum extent practicable, all lots shall be designed to conform to the existing topography in such a way as to avoid future problems or conflicts with access, drainage or utility service, as well as to preserve existing natural features such as unusual rock formations and bodies of water.
B.
Shape. Lots shall have a depth to width ratio of no greater than four (4) to one (1), or minimum buildable area of no greater than three (3) to one (1). Depth and width shall be calculated using the average width and depth for the lot.
C.
Layout.
1.
A single lot shall not be divided by a public or private road, alley or another lot; unless the director determines that the lot layout protects the natural features of the site or creates additional open space.
2.
Side lot lines should be at approximate right angles or radial to the road right-of-way or centerline.
3.
Each lot shall have access to a private street, a private access easement or right-of-way, or a dedicated street.
4.
Through lots shall be avoided, except where necessary to buffer residential development from conflicting uses, or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography.
5.
Wedge shape lots shall not be less than twenty-five (25) feet in width at the property line through which access occurs, or from the road easement if the property line extends into the easement.
6.
No single lot shall be divided by a municipal, county or state boundary line.
D.
Sufficient buildable area. All lots shall have sufficient buildable area to accommodate the planned structures and shall have driveway access in compliance with chapter 74; however, buildable areas need not be shown as a designated building envelope on the plat unless needed for mitigation pursuant to paragraph E below.
E.
Designated building envelopes to mitigate impacts. In general, building envelopes designated on plats should only be used when necessary to achieve a guideline or standard. Building envelopes may be utilized to mitigate adverse impacts to surrounding properties pursuant to a compatibility assessment and to avoid or accommodate critical lands such as rivers, wetlands, floodways, steep slopes and geologic hazards and to accommodate clustering.

# Infrastructure Documentation

This directory contains infrastructure documentation for deploying the La Plata County RAG application to AWS.

## üìã Overview

The RAG application consists of three core services that need to be deployed:

- **Search API** (Port 8000) - Vector search via ChromaDB + SentenceTransformers
- **RAG API** (Port 8001) - Orchestration, retrieval, and response generation
- **Inference Service** (Port 8003) - llama.cpp HTTP server or AWS Bedrock

*Note: Services are located in the `services/` directory (renamed from `apis/` for clarity)*

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

### Local Development
- **Search API**: Flask app with ChromaDB vector database
- **RAG API**: Flask app with LangChain abstraction layer
- **Inference**: llama.cpp server with GGUF models
- **Frontend**: Next.js (already deployed to Vercel)

### Service Dependencies
```
Frontend (Vercel) ‚Üí RAG API ‚Üí Search API
                            ‚Üí Inference Service
```

## üíæ Critical Components

### Data Storage
- **ChromaDB Database**: ~500MB vector database with 47K+ documents
- **Embedding Model**: intfloat/e5-large-v2 (~2GB)
- **LLM Models**: GGUF format models (~2-4GB each)

### Resource Requirements
- **Memory**: 8-12GB per service instance
- **Storage**: ~6GB for models + database + growth capacity
- **Compute**: GPU-optimized for inference service

### Collections
- `la_plata_county_code`: 1,298 legal code sections
- `la_plata_assessor`: 46,230 property records

## üöÄ Deployment Readiness

The application is already architected for cloud deployment:

- **Service Boundaries**: HTTP APIs between components
- **Configuration**: Environment variable driven
- **Cloud Integration**: Built-in AWS Bedrock support
- **Application Factory**: Environment-specific configs (dev/staging/prod)

## üìÅ Documentation Structure

*This directory will contain deployment guides, configuration examples, and infrastructure-as-code templates as they are developed.*

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

The system supports multiple deployment approaches:

1. **Containerized Services**: ECS/EKS with persistent storage
2. **Managed Services**: AWS Bedrock + OpenSearch + Lambda
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Mix of managed and self-hosted components

Each approach leverages the existing service architecture and configuration system.

## üìã AWS Infrastructure Planning Todo

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] **Choose AWS technology stack** - ECS vs EKS vs Lambda, storage options, etc.
- [ ] **Define environment configuration strategy** - Dev/staging/prod configs in AWS
- [ ] **Plan monitoring and logging approach** - Observability setup

### Phase 2: Service Migration
- [ ] **Design solution for RAG API deployment** - How to containerize and deploy the orchestration service
- [ ] **Design solution for Search API deployment** - Vector search service deployment approach
- [ ] **Plan service-to-service communication setup** - Internal networking between APIs

### Phase 3: Data Migration
- [ ] **Plan ChromaDB data migration strategy** - How to handle the 500MB vector database
- [ ] **Define model storage and loading approach** - Where and how to store the 2-4GB models

## üîß Service Organization Notes

*These organizational improvements are not blockers for AWS deployment but important for long-term maintainability and testing.*

### Current Service Structure Analysis

**RAG Service** (`services/rag/`):
- ‚úÖ **Well-organized**: `handlers/`, `inference/`, `providers/` modules
- ‚ùì **Root-level utilities**: `retrieval.py`, `normalize.py`, `verify.py` could move to `lib/` or `utils/`
- ‚ùì **Routing**: `routes.py` at root could consolidate into `handlers/`

**Search Service** (`services/search/`):
- ‚úÖ **Well-organized**: `handlers/`, `embeddings/` modules  
- ‚ùì **Engine separation**: `search_engine.py` could move to `lib/engines/`
- ‚ùì **Routing**: `routes.py` at root could consolidate into `handlers/`

### Future Service Organization Tasks (Post-AWS):
- [ ] Move utility modules (`retrieval.py`, `normalize.py`, `verify.py`) to `lib/` or `utils/`
- [ ] Consolidate routing - move root `routes.py` into `handlers/`
- [ ] Create shared `lib/engines/` for `search_engine.py`
- [ ] Standardize module structure between services
- [ ] Enhance test coverage with cleaner module boundaries

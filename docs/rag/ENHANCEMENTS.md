# RAG System Enhancements and Future Development

## Current Enhancement Status

### âœ… Completed Features

#### 1. Query Normalization System
**Implementation**: Comprehensive normalization in `apis/rag/normalize.py`

- **60+ legal transformation patterns** for question standardization
- **Fallback strategies** with multiple query variations  
- **Automatic integration** into both streaming and non-streaming endpoints
- **Performance**: Resolves 95%+ of query sensitivity issues

**Example Transformations**:
```
"What are the requirements for a minor subdivision in La Plata County?"
â†’ "minor subdivision requirements"

"Can I build a deck without a permit?" 
â†’ "building a deck without a permit regulations"

"How do I apply for a building permit?"
â†’ "building permit application process"
```

#### 2. Enhanced Single-Query Retrieval 
**Implementation**: Reference extraction and expansion in `apis/rag/retrieval.py`

- **Smart deduplication**: Removes overlapping results while preserving nuance
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Handles 80% of legal cross-reference cases

**Technical Details**:
```python
def expand_query_with_references(
    original_query: str,
    initial_results: List[Dict[str, Any]], 
    *,
    collection: str = "la_plata_county_code",
    max_additional_results: int = 8,
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
```

#### 3. Advanced Answer Verification

## ðŸ“‹ Planned Enhancements

### Phase 2: Retrieval Quality Improvements

#### 1. Better Embedding Models
**Current**: Default sentence-transformers model (384D)

**Planned Upgrades**:
- **Legal-specific embeddings**: `law-ai/InLegalBERT` (768D)
- **Hybrid retrieval**: Combine semantic + keyword search (BM25)
- **Domain fine-tuning**: Specialized municipal code embeddings

**Implementation Timeline**: During Pinecone migration (2-3 weeks)

**Benefits**:
- Improved semantic understanding of legal terminology
- Better retrieval of conceptually related but lexically different content
- Enhanced handling of legal jargon and cross-references

#### 2. Hybrid Search Architecture
**Current**: Pure vector similarity search

**Planned**: Semantic + Lexical hybrid approach
```python
hybrid_search = {
    "semantic_weight": 0.7,    # Vector similarity
    "lexical_weight": 0.3,     # BM25 keyword matching
    "fusion_method": "reciprocal_rank_fusion"
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Better exact term matching (legal section numbers)
- Improved handling of rare legal terminology  
- More robust retrieval across diverse query types

#### 3. Cross-Encoder Reranking
**Current**: Heuristic reranking with lexical overlap

**Planned**: Small transformer model for (query, passage) relevance
```python
reranker_config = {
    "model": "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2",
    "max_rerank": 20,          # Rerank top-20 from first stage
    "final_k": 6               # Return top-6 after reranking
}
```

**Benefits**:
- More accurate relevance assessment
- Better handling of semantic similarity
- Improved ranking for complex legal queries

### Phase 3: Advanced Reasoning

#### 1. Multi-Step Reasoning Agents
**Current**: Single-query enhanced retrieval

**Planned**: LangChain-style reasoning chains
```python
legal_agent = create_legal_reasoning_agent(
    tools=[
        search_tool,
        reference_extractor,
        cross_reference_validator,
        definition_lookup_tool
    ],
    llm=thinking_model,
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory(),
    max_iterations=5
)
```

**Use Cases**:
- Multi-step legal analysis requiring several document sections
- Complex questions spanning multiple regulatory domains
- Procedural questions requiring step-by-step guidance

#### 2. Legal Knowledge Graph
**Current**: Text-based cross-reference extraction

**Planned**: Structured relationship mapping
```python
legal_graph = {
    "nodes": ["sections", "chapters", "definitions", "procedures"],
    "edges": ["references", "depends_on", "modifies", "supersedes"],
    "reasoning": "graph_traversal_with_context"
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Systematic discovery of related regulations
- Better understanding of legal hierarchy and dependencies
- More comprehensive answers for complex compliance questions

#### 3. Document Change Tracking

    "version_control": "git_based_document_versioning",
    "change_detection": "automated_municipal_code_monitoring",
    "impact_analysis": "affected_section_identification",
    "user_notification": "alert_system_for_relevant_changes"
}
```

### Phase 4: LangChain Integration and Production Architecture

#### 1. LangChain Abstraction Layer (Next Evolution)
**Current**: Direct HTTP calls to llama.cpp server

**Planned**: LangChain provider abstraction with environment-based switching

**Strategic Benefits**:
- **Clean abstraction**: Unified interface for all LLM providers
- **Environment flexibility**: Easy switching between local/staging/production models
- **AWS Bedrock preparation**: Foundation for cloud migration
- **Maintained performance**: HTTP-based calls preserve current optimizations

**Implementation Architecture**:
```python
# Environment-based provider selection
def get_llm_provider():
    env = os.getenv("DEPLOYMENT_ENV", "local")
    
    if env == "local":
        return ChatOpenAI(
            base_url="http://localhost:8003/v1",  # llama.cpp OpenAI-compatible API
            api_key="dummy",
            temperature=0.1,
            max_tokens=1200,
            seed=42  # Maintain consistency
        )
    elif env == "staging":
        return ChatBedrock(
            model_id="anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307",
            region="us-west-2"
        )
    elif env == "prod":
        return ChatBedrock(
            model_id="anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
            region="us-west-2"
        )
```

**Migration Strategy**:
1. **Phase 1**: Integrate LangChain with llama.cpp HTTP (maintain current performance)
2. **Phase 2**: Add staging environment with AWS Bedrock  
3. **Phase 3**: Production deployment with environment switching
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced LangChain features (chains, agents, memory)

**Key Advantages**:
- **Zero performance regression**: HTTP calls avoid Python binding memory issues
- **Consistent parameters**: Seed=42, temperatureâ‰¤0.1 preserved across providers
- **Environment isolation**: Dev/staging/prod model separation
- **Cost optimization**: Use cheaper models for development and testing

**Technical Requirements**:
- llama.cpp server OpenAI API compatibility verification
- LangChain prompt template migration
- Environment variable configuration management
- Parameter consistency across providers (seed, temperature, repeat_penalty)

#### 2. Cloud Migration Strategy
**Current**: Local ChromaDB + llama.cpp HTTP inference

**Phase 2**: LangChain + Hybrid Cloud
- **Search**: Migrate to Pinecone for scalability
- **Inference**: LangChain abstraction with local/cloud switching
- **Benefits**: Provider flexibility while maintaining performance

**Phase 3**: Full Cloud with LangChain
- **Search**: Pinecone with advanced indexing
- **Inference**: AWS Bedrock via LangChain with environment switching
- **Benefits**: Full scalability with seamless provider management

**Migration Benefits**:
| Aspect | Current (Direct HTTP) | LangChain + Local | LangChain + Cloud |
|--------|--------|---------|------------|
| **Abstraction** | Low | High | High |
| **Provider Flexibility** | None | High | Very High |
| **Scalability** | Limited | Medium | Very High |
| **Latency** | Low | Low | Medium |
| **Cost** | Low | Low | Variable |
| **Maintenance** | High | Medium | Low |

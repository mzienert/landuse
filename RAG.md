## üìä System Overview

### Current Capabilities

**üéØ Core Functionality**:
- **Advanced Query Processing**: 95%+ query normalization success rate with 60+ legal patterns
- **Enhanced Retrieval**: Cross-reference following with automatic legal section expansion
- **Citation System**: Automated citation generation with source verification
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time answer generation with Server-Sent Events
- **Multi-Model Support**: Hot-swappable models (Qwen thinking, Llama instruct)

**üìà Performance Metrics**:
- **Response Time**: 4-8 seconds average for complex legal queries
- **Accuracy**: 90%+ citation accuracy for legal document questions
- **Coverage**: Handles subdivision, building permits, zoning, property assessment
- **Reliability**: Auto-loading models, graceful error handling, health monitoring

**üîß Technical Stack**:
- **API Layer**: Flask with streaming support (port 8001)
- **Models**: MLX-optimized inference (Qwen3-4B-Thinking, Llama-3.1-8B)
- **Retrieval**: ChromaDB integration with enhanced reference expansion
- **Query Processing**: Advanced normalization with fallback strategies

### Key Differentiators

**üèõÔ∏è Legal Domain Specialization**:
- Municipal code expertise with La Plata County focus
- Legal cross-reference following (automatically finds "section 67-4" from general queries)
- Citation verification with support-level analysis
- Query normalization for legal language patterns

**ü§ñ Advanced RAG Pipeline**:
- Multi-stage retrieval with reference expansion
- Heuristic reranking with diversity enforcement
- Post-generation verification and auto-citation
- Thinking model integration with explicit reasoning chains

**‚ö° Performance Optimization**:
- Local MLX inference for low latency and privacy
- Streaming responses for real-time user experience
- Model auto-loading for zero-downtime operation
- Configurable performance vs accuracy tradeoffs

## RAG System Guide

This document describes the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) service that runs alongside the existing search API. It covers setup, starting/stopping, model loading, testing (streaming and non-streaming), and future enhancements.

### Overview

- Service: `apis/rag/rag_api.py` (Flask, port 8001)
- Script: `scripts/run_rag.sh` (start/stop/status/logs)
- Components:
  - `apis/rag/inference.py`: MLX model manager for loading and generating
  - `apis/rag/retrieval.py`: Calls existing search service to fetch top-K context, builds prompt with SOURCES
  - `apis/rag/verify.py`: Citation verification and support checking
  - `apis/rag/rag_api.py`: Endpoints to load model and answer questions (streaming/non-streaming)
- Dependencies: MLX, MLX-LM, Flask, Flask-CORS, Requests (for retrieval calls)

Notes:
- The RAG service depends on the existing search API at `http://localhost:8000` for retrieval.
- The current implementation retrieves top-K passages and includes them in the prompt. Reranking and verification come later.

---

## Setup

Activate your virtual environment and install required packages:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
pip install mlx mlx-lm flask flask-cors requests
```

Ensure the search API is running (for retrieval):

```bash
./scripts/api.sh start
```

---

## Start/Stop RAG API

```bash
# Start RAG API (port 8001)
./scripts/run_rag.sh start

# Check status
./scripts/run_rag.sh status

# Tail logs
./scripts/run_rag.sh logs

# Stop RAG API
./scripts/run_rag.sh stop
```

Health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/rag/health | jq
```

Expected fields include: `model_loaded`, `mlx_available`, `model_id`, and endpoints.

---

## Load a Model (on demand)

Use a compatible MLX model. Example tested locally:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/rag/model/load \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model_id":"mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507-8bit"}' | jq
```

Health should now report `model_loaded: true` and the `model_id`.

If you plan to use a legal fine-tune (e.g., Llama3-LegalLM) and an MLX variant is available, supply that `model_id` instead. Otherwise, use a compatible Llama 3 Instruct variant as fallback.

---

## Test Non-Streaming Answer

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/rag/answer \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query":"Summarize subdivision requirements in La Plata County",
    "collection":"la_plata_county_code",
    "num_results":5
  }' | jq
```

Response includes the `answer` and `sources` metadata. The answer is grounded on retrieved SOURCES included in the prompt.

---

## Test Streaming Answer (SSE)

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8001/rag/answer/stream \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query":"Summarize subdivision requirements in La Plata County",
    "collection":"la_plata_county_code",
    "num_results":5
  }'
```

Stream events:
- `start`: indicates whether a model is loaded
- `token`: token/text chunks
- `error`: error details if generation fails
- `end`: end-of-stream marker, with final metadata fields

Note: Depending on MLX-LM version, generation may return full text. The service emulates streaming by chunking the text into word-like pieces.

---

## Heuristic Reranker (v1)

The RAG service applies a lightweight reranker to first-stage retrieval results before building the prompt.

- What it does
  - Scores each candidate by lexical overlap with the query (Jaccard over simple tokens)
  - Blends in the retrieval service's relevance when available
  - Enforces diversity: skips near-duplicates using a similarity threshold

- Defaults and knobs
  - `top_k`: up to 6 final chunks are selected (bounded by `num_results` in your request)
  - `diversity_threshold`: 0.8 Jaccard; higher = more aggressive de-duplication
  - `max_chunk_chars`: 1200 characters per chunk fed to the model

- How to test selection size
  - Ask for more initial results, e.g. `num_results: 8`; the reranker will reduce to ≤6 diverse passages
  ```bash
  curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8001/rag/answer/stream \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "query":"Summarize subdivision requirements in La Plata County",
      "collection":"la_plata_county_code",
      "num_results":8
    }'
  ```

- Limitations (by design for v1)
  - Uses simple lexical signals (fast, fully local)
  - May miss semantically relevant content with low lexical overlap
  - Future: evaluate adding a small cross-encoder or better semantic rerank

---

## Citations and Sources

Non-stream responses include:
- `answer`: final text; the model is instructed to include citations like `[1]`, `[2]` that refer to SOURCES.
- `citations`: array of `{ marker, id, collection }` extracted from the answer.
- `sources`: the subset of retrieved sources actually referenced in `answer` (each includes `index`, `id`, `collection`, `preview`, and `chunk`).

Behavior:
- The prompt enforces citation usage for material claims.
- If the model omits markers, a best-effort auto-citation fallback analyzes overlap and inserts minimal citations (and will attach at least `[1]` if any sources exist).
- Streaming endpoint does not include final citations (no buffering). Use the non-stream endpoint when you need structured `citations`/`sources` in the response.

Example (non-stream):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/rag/answer \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query":"Summarize subdivision requirements in La Plata County",
    "collection":"la_plata_county_code",
    "num_results":6
  }' | jq '{answer, citations, sources}'
```

---

## Lightweight Verification (v1)

Non-stream responses include a verification report based on lexical support checks:

- What it does
  - Splits the answer into sentences and checks each against retrieved source chunks using token-level Jaccard overlap.
  - Appends a citation marker [n] to supported sentences when missing; flags unsupported ones with “(insufficient support)”.
  - Returns `verification` with counts and per-sentence details.

- Where to see it
  - Non-stream endpoint returns `verification` and the annotated `answer`.
  - Streaming endpoint does not include verification (no buffering).

Example (non-stream):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/rag/answer \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query":"Summarize subdivision requirements in La Plata County",
    "collection":"la_plata_county_code",
    "num_results":6
  }' | jq '{answer, citations, sources, verification}'
```

---

## Request Fields

- `query` (string, required): user question
- `collection` (string): `la_plata_county_code` or `la_plata_assessor` (defaults to code)
- `num_results` (int): retrieval K (1–10)
- Optional generation controls (currently may be ignored by some MLX-LM versions):
  - `max_tokens` (int)
  - `temperature` (float)
  - `top_p` (float)

---

## Troubleshooting

- Model not loaded: Load a model via `/rag/model/load`.
- Retrieval errors: Ensure the search API (`./scripts/api.sh start`) is running on port 8000.
- MLX argument issues: The service uses a minimal call; version differences are handled by fallbacks and streaming emulation.
- Performance: If generation is slow or OOMs, try a smaller model/quantization (e.g., 4-bit). Close other memory-intensive apps.

### No citations returned
- Ensure the search API is running and returning results (citations only appear when sources exist):
  ```bash
  ./scripts/api.sh status
  curl "http://localhost:8000/search/simple?query=Subdivision%20requirements&collection=la_plata_county_code&num_results=5" | jq
  ```
- If `results` is empty, build embeddings or fix data. If retrieval works but `citations` is still empty, use non-stream endpoint and confirm `sources` is non-empty; auto-citation will then attach minimal markers.

---

## Current Limitations (to be addressed in later steps)

- No reranking: passages are taken as-is from first-stage retrieval
- No strict citation enforcement or post-answer verification
- Streaming is best-effort and can be word-level depending on backend

## 🎛️ RAG System Tuning Parameters

This section documents all configurable parameters ("knobs") that can be adjusted to optimize the RAG system for accuracy, performance, and reliability.

### 🔍 Retrieval Stage Parameters

#### Collection Selection
```python
# Which collections to search
collections = ["la_plata_county_code", "la_plata_assessor"]  # Both
collections = ["la_plata_county_code"]  # Legal only
collections = ["la_plata_assessor"]     # Property only
```

**Impact**: Broader search increases recall but may reduce precision

#### Retrieval Count (K)
```python
num_results = 12  # Default: retrieve top-12 chunks per collection
```

**Tuning Guidelines:**
- **Lower (6-8)**: Faster, more precise, risk missing relevant content
- **Higher (15-20)**: Better recall, slower, more noise for reranker
- **Sweet spot**: 10-15 for legal queries, 8-12 for property queries

#### Distance Threshold
```python
max_distance = 0.8  # Only retrieve chunks with similarity > 0.2
```

**Tuning Guidelines:**
- **Stricter (0.6-0.7)**: Higher precision, may miss relevant but dissimilar content
- **Looser (0.8-0.9)**: Better recall, more noise
- **Sweet spot**: 0.75 for legal text, 0.8 for property data

### 📊 Reranking Stage Parameters

#### Heuristic Reranking (Current)
```python
# Scoring weights
similarity_weight = 0.6      # Base cosine similarity score
freshness_weight = 0.1       # Newer content bonus (if timestamps available)
diversity_weight = 0.2       # Cross-source diversity bonus
length_weight = 0.1          # Optimal chunk length bonus

# Diversity constraints
max_chunks_per_source = 2    # Limit chunks from same document
min_source_diversity = 0.3   # Minimum difference between chunks
diversity_threshold = 0.8    # Jaccard similarity threshold for deduplication
```

#### Deduplication
```python
# Remove near-duplicate chunks
dedup_threshold = 0.85      # Cosine similarity threshold for duplicates
dedup_method = "embedding"  # Options: "embedding", "text", "hybrid"
```

**Tuning Guidelines:**
- **Stricter (0.90+)**: Only removes very similar chunks
- **Looser (0.75-0.80)**: Removes more duplicates, risk losing nuanced differences
- **Sweet spot**: 0.85 for legal text, 0.80 for property data

### 📦 Context Packing Parameters

#### Chunk Selection
```python
max_chunks_in_context = 6    # Number of chunks to include in prompt (top_k)
target_context_length = 4000 # Target token count for all chunks
max_context_length = 6000    # Hard limit to avoid truncation
max_chunk_chars = 1200       # Characters per chunk fed to model
```

**Tuning Guidelines:**
- **Fewer chunks (3-4)**: More focused, faster, risk missing supporting evidence
- **More chunks (8-10)**: Comprehensive coverage, slower, potential confusion
- **Sweet spot**: 5-7 chunks for complex legal queries

#### Context Organization
```python
# How to arrange chunks in prompt
context_order = "relevance"  # Options: "relevance", "source", "chronological"
include_metadata = True      # Include section numbers, account IDs, etc.
source_separation = True     # Clear separators between different sources
```

### 🤖 Generation Stage Parameters

#### Model Configuration
```python
# Model selection
model_name = "mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507-8bit"    # Current thinking model
fallback_model = "mlx-community/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-4bit" # Tested fallback
quantization = "8bit"                # Options: "4bit", "8bit", "fp16"

# Thinking model considerations
thinking_model_tokens = 1200         # Minimum recommended for complete reasoning
standard_model_tokens = 800          # Sufficient for direct responses
```

#### Generation Parameters
```python
# Core generation settings
temperature = 0.3           # Lower = more deterministic, higher = more creative
top_p = 0.9                # Nucleus sampling threshold
max_tokens = 1200          # Maximum response length (updated for thinking models)
min_tokens = 100           # Minimum response length (prevent truncation)
```

**Tuning Guidelines:**

##### Temperature
- **Low (0.1-0.3)**: Precise, factual, deterministic - ideal for legal queries
- **Medium (0.4-0.6)**: Balanced creativity and accuracy
- **High (0.7-1.0)**: Creative but less reliable - avoid for legal content

##### Token Limits
- **Conservative (600-800)**: Concise answers, may miss details
- **Generous (1200-1500)**: Comprehensive reasoning, good for thinking models
- **Thinking models**: 1200+ tokens recommended for complete reasoning process
- **Sweet spot**: 1200 tokens for legal explanations with thinking models

### ✅ Verification Stage Parameters

#### Citation Validation
```python
# Citation checking
require_citations = True
min_citations_per_claim = 1     # Each factual claim needs ≥1 citation
citation_similarity_threshold = 0.7  # How similar claim must be to source

# Unsupported content handling
unsupported_action = "soften"   # Options: "remove", "soften", "flag", "allow"
uncertainty_phrases = ["may", "typically", "generally", "often"]
```

#### Verification Parameters (Current Implementation)
```python
# Lexical support checking
jaccard_threshold = 0.15    # Minimum token overlap for sentence support
support_check_enabled = True
auto_citation_enabled = True  # Add citations to supported sentences
```

### 🔧 Performance vs. Accuracy Tradeoffs

#### High Accuracy Configuration
```python
# Maximizes accuracy, slower performance
num_results = 15
max_chunks_in_context = 8
temperature = 0.2
max_tokens = 1500           # Extra tokens for detailed reasoning
diversity_threshold = 0.9   # More aggressive deduplication
citation_similarity_threshold = 0.8
```

#### Balanced Configuration (Recommended)
```python
# Good accuracy with reasonable speed
num_results = 12
max_chunks_in_context = 6
temperature = 0.3
max_tokens = 1200           # Default for thinking models
diversity_threshold = 0.8
citation_similarity_threshold = 0.7
```

#### High Performance Configuration
```python
# Faster responses, slightly lower accuracy
num_results = 8
max_chunks_in_context = 4
temperature = 0.4
max_tokens = 800            # Shorter for speed
diversity_threshold = 0.75
citation_similarity_threshold = 0.6
```

### 🎯 Quick Tuning Recipes

#### For Legal Queries (High Precision)
```python
config = {
    "collection": "la_plata_county_code",
    "num_results": 12,
    "max_chunks_in_context": 6,
    "temperature": 0.2,
    "diversity_threshold": 0.85,
    "citation_similarity_threshold": 0.8
}
```

#### For Property Searches (High Recall)  
```python
config = {
    "collection": "la_plata_assessor",
    "num_results": 15,
    "max_chunks_in_context": 8,
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "diversity_threshold": 0.8,
    "citation_similarity_threshold": 0.7
}
```

#### For General Questions (Balanced)

config = {
    "collection": "la_plata_county_code",  # or both collections
    "num_results": 10,
    "max_chunks_in_context": 5,
    "temperature": 0.35,
    "diversity_threshold": 0.8,
    "citation_similarity_threshold": 0.7
}
```

### 🔍 Debugging Parameter Issues

#### Common Issues and Parameter Adjustments

**Issue: Responses lack relevant information**
- ↑ Increase `num_results` (8 → 12)
- ↓ Lower distance threshold in search API
- ↓ Reduce `diversity_threshold` (0.8 → 0.75) to allow more similar chunks

**Issue: Responses are too generic**
- ↓ Decrease `temperature` (0.4 → 0.2)
- ↑ Increase `citation_similarity_threshold` (0.7 → 0.8)
- ↓ Reduce `max_chunks_in_context` (8 → 5)

**Issue: Missing citations**
- Enable `auto_citation_enabled`
- ↓ Lower `jaccard_threshold` (0.15 → 0.10)
- ↓ Lower `citation_similarity_threshold` (0.7 → 0.6)

**Issue: Slow response times**
- ↓ Reduce `num_results` (12 → 8)
- ↓ Lower `max_tokens` (1200 → 800)
- ↓ Reduce `max_chunks_in_context` (6 → 4)
- Use 4-bit quantization instead of 8-bit

**Issue: Inconsistent quality**
- ↓ Lower `temperature` for consistency (0.3 → 0.2)
- ↑ Increase `diversity_threshold` to reduce redundant chunks
- Enable stricter verification settings

**Issue: Too many duplicate/similar sources**
- ↑ Increase `diversity_threshold` (0.8 → 0.85)
- ↓ Reduce `max_chunks_per_source` (default → 1)
- Enable `min_source_diversity` constraint

### 📊 Configuration Management

#### Environment-Based Configs
```python
# config/development.json
{
    "retrieval": {"num_results": 15},
    "generation": {"temperature": 0.2},
    "verification": {"strict_mode": True}
}

# config/production.json  
{
    "retrieval": {"num_results": 10},
    "generation": {"temperature": 0.3},
    "verification": {"strict_mode": False}
}
```

## 🚀 Prototype → Production Path

The system is designed for gradual migration from local development to cloud production:

### Phase 1: Current (Local)
- Search API → ChromaDB
- RAG API → MLX

### Phase 2: Hybrid  
- Search API → Pinecone (cloud)
- RAG API → MLX (still local)

### Phase 3: Full Cloud
- Search API → Pinecone
- RAG API → Bedrock

**Benefits of Phased Approach:**
- **Independent migration** - Move services separately without dependencies
- **Risk mitigation** - Test cloud integration incrementally  
- **Cost optimization** - Optimize each service's cloud architecture individually
- **Development velocity** - Continue local development while migrating production

**Architecture Considerations:**
- Current HTTP APIs translate directly to cloud service boundaries
- Separate Flask apps provide deployment flexibility (ECS, Lambda, App Runner)
- Clean interfaces enable gradual backend swapping without API changes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Case Study: Source Truncation

### Problem Discovery
During testing with minor subdivision queries, we discovered sources were being truncated mid-sentence:
```
"Less than ten thousa" [cut off]
```

### Investigation Process
1. **Initial Hypothesis**: Token limits too low for thinking model
   - ✅ **Fixed**: Increased `max_tokens` from 256 → 1200 for complete reasoning
   
2. **Source Truncation Persisted**: Despite token increase, sources still truncated at same point
   - 🔍 **Root Cause**: RAG retrieval was truncating chunks to 1200 characters for LLM prompt
   - 🔍 **Secondary Issue**: Final API response used truncated chunks instead of full source text

### Technical Solution
**Problem**: Two truncation points in pipeline
```python
# In build_prompt_with_sources()
chunk = text[:max_chunk_chars]  # Truncated for LLM prompt
sources_meta.append({"chunk": chunk})  # Truncated saved to response
```

**Fix**: Separate prompt chunks from response chunks
```python
sources_meta.append({
    "chunk": text,              # Store full text for final response
    "truncated_chunk": chunk,   # Store truncated for prompt building
})
```

**Parameters Updated**:
- `max_chunk_chars`: 1200 → 3000 characters
- `max_tokens`: 256 → 1200 tokens for thinking models

### Model Behavior Validation
The thinking model correctly identified insufficient information:
- ✅ **Accurate legal reasoning**: Recognized Chapter 67 references but lacked actual content
- ✅ **Proper citations**: Referenced available sources [1], [2], [3] appropriately  
- ✅ **Transparent limitations**: Stated "information is insufficient" rather than speculating
- ✅ **Complete reasoning process**: Full `<thinking>` analysis with 1200+ tokens

### Follow-up Query Success
Manual search for `section 67-4 minor subdivisions` returned complete requirements:
- **Applicability**: Land divisions into three (3) or fewer lots
- **Procedures**: Minor land use permit process (section 66-20)
- **Approval criteria**: General land use permit criteria (section 66-16)  
- **Timeline**: 3-year recording requirement

### Key Learning
**Dense legal text requires multi-step retrieval**: Initial query returned procedural references, but actual requirements were in different sections. This demonstrates the need for **iterative retrieval strategies** for complex legal questions.

---

## 🔄 Multi-Step Retrieval Considerations

### Current Challenge
Legal questions often require information from multiple cross-referenced sections:
- Query: "Minor subdivision requirements" 
- Initial results: Chapter 66 (procedures, references to 67-4)
- Required follow-up: Section 67-4 (actual requirements)

### Potential Solutions

#### Option 1: Enhanced Single-Query Retrieval
```python
# Expand initial retrieval with cross-references
def expand_query_with_references(query, initial_results):
    references = extract_section_references(initial_results)
    expanded_queries = [query] + [f"section {ref}" for ref in references]
    return combined_search(expanded_queries)
```

#### Option 2: LangChain-Style Multi-Step Agent
```python
# Sequential retrieval with reasoning
def multi_step_retrieval(query):
    step1 = search(query)
    analysis = analyze_gaps(step1)
    if analysis.needs_additional_sources:
        step2 = search(analysis.follow_up_queries)
        return combine_sources(step1, step2)
    return step1
```

#### Option 3: Graph-Based Legal Navigation  
```python
# Build relationship graph between legal sections
legal_graph = build_section_relationships()
def traverse_legal_requirements(query):
    initial_sections = search(query)
    related_sections = legal_graph.find_related(initial_sections)
    return comprehensive_search(initial_sections + related_sections)
```

**Recommendation**: Start with Option 1 (reference extraction) as it's simpler to implement and addresses 80% of cross-reference cases without complex orchestration.

### ✅ Implementation Status: Option 1 Completed

**Enhanced Single-Query Retrieval** has been successfully implemented in `apis/rag/retrieval.py`:

#### Reference Extraction Function
```python
def extract_section_references(results: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[str]:
    """Extract section references from retrieval results.
    
    Looks for patterns like:
    - "section 67-4"  
    - "Chapter 67"
    - "67-4" (with legal context)
    - "(see section 66-20)"
    """
```

#### Query Expansion Function  
```python
def expand_query_with_references(
    original_query: str,
    initial_results: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    *,
    collection: str = "la_plata_county_code", 
    max_additional_results: int = 8,
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Expand retrieval by following section references found in initial results.
    
    Returns combined and deduplicated results from original query + reference queries.
    """
```

#### Integration
The enhanced retrieval is now active in both RAG API endpoints:
- `/rag/answer` (non-streaming)
- `/rag/answer/stream` (streaming)

#### Test Results
**Query**: "What are the requirements for minor subdivisions?"

**Before Enhancement**: Only returned Chapter 66 procedural sections with references to section 67-4 but no actual requirements.

**After Enhancement**: Successfully retrieves section 67-4 with complete requirements:
- **Applicability**: Land divisions into 3 or fewer lots
- **Procedures**: Figure 67-4 application steps  
- **Approval criteria**: General land use permit criteria (section 66-16)
- **Effect of approval**: Must record with county clerk within 3 years

**Performance**: No significant latency impact. Reference extraction and follow-up queries complete within the same response time.

#### Coverage
The system now handles:
- ✅ Cross-section references (e.g., "pursuant to section 67-4")  
- ✅ Chapter references (e.g., "procedures in chapter 67")
- ✅ Contextual legal references (e.g., "see section 66-20")
- ✅ Automatic deduplication of overlapping results
- ✅ Limit of 3 top references to prevent query explosion

#### Known Limitations

**Query Sensitivity**: Initial retrieval results vary based on exact query phrasing, affecting reference expansion success:

- ✅ **Works Well**: `"minor subdivision requirements"` → finds section 67-4
- ⚠️ **Inconsistent**: `"What are the requirements for a minor subdivision..."` → may only find Chapter 66

**Root Cause**: Different query phrasings return different initial search results from the vector database, which may or may not contain the key references needed for expansion.

**Workaround**: Users can try alternative phrasings if initial results seem incomplete.

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Enhanced Retrieval Quality

To address the remaining 20% of query sensitivity issues:

#### 1. Query Normalization (Common in RAG)
```python
def normalize_legal_query(query: str) -> str:
    """Standardize legal query phrasing for better retrieval."""
    # Legal-specific patterns
    patterns = [
        (r"what are the requirements for (.*)", r"\1 requirements"),
        (r"how do I (.*)", r"\1 process"),
        (r"tell me about (.*)", r"\1"),
    ]
    
    normalized = query.lower()
    for pattern, replacement in patterns:
        normalized = re.sub(pattern, replacement, normalized)
    return normalized
```

**Benefits**: More consistent initial retrieval results regardless of user phrasing

#### 2. Better Embedding Model
Current: Default sentence-transformers model
**Upgrades**:
- Legal-specific embeddings (e.g., legal-bert variants)
- Domain fine-tuning on municipal code text
- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Pinecone migration considerations
embeddings = {
    "current": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",  # 384D, general purpose
    "legal": "law-ai/InLegalBERT",   # 768D, legal-specific
    "hybrid": "bge-large-en-v1.5"   # 1024D, best retrieval performance
}
```

#### 3. LangChain Agent Integration (Phase 2)
For complex multi-step legal analysis requiring true reasoning chains:

```python
agent = create_legal_retrieval_agent(
    tools=[
        search_tool,
        reference_extractor, 
        cross_reference_validator
    ],
    llm=thinking_model,
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory(),
    max_iterations=3
)
```

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Quick Win**: Query normalization (1-2 days)
2. **Medium Impact**: Better embeddings during Pinecone migration (1 week)  
3. **High Impact**: LangChain agents for complex reasoning (2-3 weeks)

### RAG Industry Context

**Query Normalization**: Standard practice in production RAG systems
- Used by legal AI companies (Harvey, Casetext)
- Common in enterprise search (Microsoft Viva Topics)
- Essential for consistent user experience

**Multi-Modal Retrieval**: Current best practice combines:
- Dense retrieval (embeddings)
- Sparse retrieval (BM25/keyword)  
- Query expansion (synonyms, reformulation)
- Reference following (our current enhancement ✅)

## Additional Future Enhancements (Notes)

- UI comparison mode: When a UI is available, display the baseline (previous step) answer side-by-side with the augmented (RAG) answer for comparison.
- Cross-encoder reranking: Add small transformer for (query, passage) relevance scoring
- Strict citation policy: Enforce that claims are supported by SOURCES; add inline markers [1], [2] and a sources section.
- Advanced verification: Post-generate support check; remove or soften unsupported statements.
- Configurable parameters: Expose all tuning knobs in the UI and config files.
- Sessioning and feedback: Store conversations and thumbs up/down; learn from feedback.
- Caching: Retrieval and prompt+sources generation caches.
- Evaluation harness: Gold Q&A set with metrics (hit@k, citation precision, supported-claims ratio, latency, token usage).
- Observability: Structured logs and dashboards for latency and usage.
- Retrieval quality:
  - Filter out "Reserved" sections during retrieval to reduce noise before reranking.
  - Add a small post-processor to clean incomplete/dangling citation tokens (e.g., a trailing "[4").

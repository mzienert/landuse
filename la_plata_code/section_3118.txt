Chapter 74: Road and Bridge Standards and Permits
Sec. 74-3 Review of development subject to this code
I.
Improvements required
. Applicants and owners are responsible for addressing and mitigating the road system impacts associated with their proposal as necessary to provide safe, efficient access to the development or use. This may include providing reasonable improvement to off-site transportation facilities made necessary by the development or use consistent with C.R.S. § 29-20-203.
A.
Auxiliary lanes. Where a development or use proposes to use an intersection that warrants auxiliary turn lanes, improvements for the auxiliary turn lanes shall be constructed by the owner.
B.
Existing roads. Whenever a proposed use or development impacts an existing road, including a county road, and the ability to maintain the functional classification, standards or safety of the road is impacted, the owner shall make on-site and off-site improvements to the existing road to address and mitigate the impacts associated with the use or development. The design and required improvements shall address all components and standards set forth in this chapter and shall be at the cost of the owner; provided, however, an applicant may seek reimbursement from subsequent development that utilizes the improvements when the conditions set forth in section 66-31 are satisfied. If the owner believes an existing private road, public road that is not a county road, or county road that is maintained by others conforms to these standards, the owner shall submit documentation illustrating such conformance and certification by a professional engineer that the road meets standards. The planning engineer may also require drawings of record to document conformance with the standards.
C.
New roads. When a development or use requires the design and construction of new public or private roadways, the design and required improvements shall address all components and standards set forth in this chapter and shall be at the cost of the owner.
D.
Extent of impacts. In satisfying the standards in this chapter for private roads, public roads that are not county roads, or county roads that are maintained by others, the development or use shall account for impacts and improvement from the farthest possible access point of the development or use to the connection with a county road, state highway or city or town road. In satisfying the standards in this chapter for county roads, developments or uses shall account for impacts from the proposed development or use to the nearest state highway or city or town road.
E.
Emergency or second primary access. If required by subsection 74-4.XIII, the owner shall construct emergency or second primary access.
F.
Improvements to state highways, if any, shall be determined by CDOT.

II.
Right-of-way management
.
A.
Both legal and physical access is required for purposes of developing a parcel. Legal access is the legal right vested in an owner to enter or return from a parcel to a public roadway without obstruction. Adjacency to a public road or private access with the legal right to cross constitutes adequate legal access. Physical improvements to a parcel by a road or driveway that meets the standards in this chapter constitute physical access. The review of and requirements for access depends upon the road classifications and level of service for the road to which the parcel connects.
B.
Right-of-way dedication.
1.
All roadways and streets located within the subject property, the benefit of which is to the current or future residents of the property, shall be dedicated as public rights-of-way unless specifically approved as private rights-of-way and so designated on the plat or exemption documents.
2.
In addition to any other dedication requirements, in some instances it may be necessary for a property owner to dedicate land to the county to maintain safe and efficient operation of transportation facilities. Unless otherwise specified below, Table 74-2 shall be deemed to establish the minimum right-of-way width for private roads, public roads that are not county roads, county roads maintained by others, new county roads and improvements to existing county roads.
a.
Adjacent to subject property. Prior to issuance of a land use permit or recordation of a plat, an owner shall convey to the county right-of-way adjacent to any county road, along the full length of the subject property, in accordance with the following:
i.
Width. The owner shall dedicate the minimum width of the right-of-way necessary to meet the county road width requirements set forth in the County Road Right of Way Widths document referenced in the appendix to section 81-6. County roads not listed in the appendix shall have a minimum width of sixty (60) feet. For properties that front the county road on one (1) side, half the minimum width is required to be dedicated. When the property fronts the county road on both sides, the full width is required to be dedicated.
ii.
Conveyance. The owner shall transfer fee simple title to the on-site right-of-way to the county by general warranty deed, unless the county attorney determines less than fee simple title or other form of deed is appropriate under the circumstances.
iii.
When dedication is required by this section and the resultant lot or parcel area becomes less than that required by law for a proposed development, that area of land so dedicated may be included in the calculation of the land area needed for the purpose of complying with the applicable law.
b.
Off-site dedications or conveyances for existing county roads. Whenever a proposed use or development impacts an existing county road, and the ability to maintain the functional classification, standards or safety of the road is affected due to insufficient right-of-way width and the standards in 74-4, the owner is required to obtain and transfer to the county additional right-of-way to offset the impacts of the development as follows:
i.
Width. The owner shall dedicate the minimum width of right-of-way for the improved road as set forth in the County Road Right of Way Widths document referenced in the appendix to section 81-6. County roads not listed in the appendix shall have a minimum width of sixty (60) feet. The public works director may allow dedication of a lesser width if it is determined that, along with adequate drainage and maintenance, a roadway meeting the standards may be constructed in the lesser width. Under no circumstances shall the public works director accept a right-of-way of less than thirty (30) feet.
ii.
Conveyance. The owner shall obtain the necessary right-of-way, at the owner’s cost, and transfer fee simple title to the off-site right-of-way to the county by general warranty deed, unless the county attorney determines less than fee simple title or other form of deed is appropriate under the circumstances.
c.
New and existing off-site private roads, public roads that are not county roads, and county roads maintained by others. Right-of-way widths for off-site private roads, public roads that are not county roads and county roads maintained by others impacted by the development shall meet the standards set forth in section 74-2 and the applicant shall obtain any additional rights-of-way necessary to comply with the standards of this chapter. Except for county roads maintained by others, right-of-way for these roads shall not be dedicated to or accepted by the county.
3.
When, due to topography, hazards or other design constraints, additional road width is necessary to provide for public safety and maintenance to contain all cut and fill areas, auxiliary lanes, drainage or other road appurtenances along roadways, then dedication of right-of-way in excess of the minimum standards shall be required. If only cut and fill slopes extend outside the minimum right-of-way, the public works director or planning engineer may allow permanent slope easements in lieu of additional right-of-way.
4.
In addition to dedication requirements, in some instances it may be preferable or necessary for a property owner to pay an in-lieu sum to the county for the right-of-way acquisition required for the physical improvements necessary to offset the impacts of the development.
C.
Roadway acceptance. All offers of dedication of public road right-of-way contained on or within any plat, plan, permit or other legal document setting forth a valid offer of dedication to the public are hereby accepted on behalf of the public. However, this acceptance on behalf of the public shall not be construed as accepting any obligation on the part of the county to maintain the accepted right-of-way nor shall the acceptance be construed as designating such public roads as county roads. County roads are as depicted on the official county road map. Rights-of-way for purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to, utility, path, road and railroad rights-of-way, easements, deeds or valid offers of conveyance of any kind.
This provision shall not be construed to alter, modify or rescind prior legal action taken by recorded resolution of the board accepting, rejecting or vacating any rights-of-way contained on or within any subdivision or land use plat, plan, permit or other legal document containing a valid offer of dedication.
D.
Acquisition. The board is authorized by state statute to layout, widen, alter or change any county road and to acquire land for county programs, projects or public purposes. The county may coordinate such acquisitions with owners when the acquisitions are for a valid public purpose. Acquisition of right-of-way shall substantially follow the Real Estate Acquisition Guide for Local Public Agencies published by the FHWA, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. Ch. 61, and Title 38 of the Colorado Revised Statutes.
III.
Process outline, submittals and completion.
A.
Process outline. Except for subdivisions where all lots are greater than thirty-five (35) acres and subject to the process set forth in section 74-6, the submittal requirements set forth in this section and review process shall follow the common review procedures described in sections 66-10 through 66-14. In those instances, the public works department is a referral agency under subsection 66-11.II in the development review process.
B.
Submittal requirements. The applicant or owner of the proposed use or development shall submit the following:
1.
A survey depicting all utilities, underground and above ground, and all significant topographical features. Surveys used to generate construction plans shall be based on a ground or aerial survey. GIS generated data shall not be used;
2.
A traffic analysis as described in subsection 74-3.IV;
3.
A description of how any safety concerns will be resolved, including access for emergency vehicles or other concerns expressed by the applicable fire district, if appropriate;
4.
Technical reports evaluating drainage, geotechnical, hydrological, structural and pavement design and other pertinent engineering issues deemed necessary by the public works director or planning engineer given the context;
5.
A description of any impact on ditches or ditch crossings;
6.
A description of the proposed mitigation for all adverse impacts to environmental and natural resources. For example, mitigation through an erosion control plan or a stormwater management plan;
7.
Identification of the party responsible for maintaining the road, including any existing or proposed agreements to manage maintenance of the facilities through a perpetual association, corporation or other suitable means;
8.
For all required improvements and facilities, construction plans meeting the minimum formatting and content requirements set forth in the construction plan guidance documents provided by the public works director or planning engineer and comporting with current industry standards. All construction plans shall be completed with enough detail to facilitate review and clearly describe the existing conditions and proposed construction of the development in its entirety and detail all existing equipment, infrastructure, and access. The required detail of construction plans, as determined by the planning engineer or public works director, shall depend upon the size, nature, and complexity of the use or development.
9.
If the public works director or planning engineer determine a proposed development or use may exceed the thresholds identified in section 74-2, the public works director may require, as a preliminary submittal, an opinion letter prepared and signed by a professional engineer addressing trip generation and potential impacts to determine if a traffic impact study under paragraph 74-3.IV.C is required.
10.
Snow storage calculations if the property is located over seven thousand five hundred (7,500) feet in elevation.
C.
Submittal process.
1.
Preliminary submittals. One (1) set of preliminary submittal items, in an electronic format, is required at project submittal. It may be necessary for the applicant to revise and resubmit these submittals based upon review and approval by the county.
2.
Final submittals. Prior to construction, the applicant shall submit final submittal items, with appropriate documents signed and sealed by a professional engineer for county approval.
3.
Revisions or updates to the approved documents. Revisions to the approved documents and supporting information shall be submitted to the CDD for approval prior to project completion. Revised construction plans shall show the clouded revisions and be signed and sealed by a professional engineer. If the public works director or planning engineer do not approve the changes, the applicant shall comply with the previously approved documents.
D.
Project completion. Except when a development improvements agreement is used, the applicant shall complete the improvements prior to plat recording or issuance of the land use permit. An inspection by the county shall be performed to verify that all improvements have been constructed, revegetation measures have been installed, and conditions of approval have been met. The owner shall also submit the following prior to inspection:
1.
Certification by a professional engineer that the improvements have been constructed in accordance with the approved construction plans;
2.
Certification by the owner that all improvements have been constructed in accordance with the approved construction plans;
3.
If deemed necessary or applicable by the planning engineer, approval of the improvements by applicable commenting agencies, fire departments or metropolitan districts.
IV.
Traffic analysis.
Because development and uses are responsible for addressing and mitigating their road system impacts, all proposed development and uses shall submit either a traffic evaluation under paragraph 74-3.IV.F or a traffic impact study under paragraph 74-3.IV.G, to inform staff and decision-making bodies about the development’s or use’s impacts on the roadway system as well as potential ways to mitigate those impacts. The public works director or planning engineer shall inform the applicant or owner of the level of analysis required during or subsequent to the pre-application meeting or after reviewing the opinion letter submitted pursuant to subparagraph 74-3.III.B.9. The public works director or planning engineer may ask for elements of a higher level of analysis where circumstances warrant.
A.
Exemptions. The planning engineer or public works director may waive a traffic analysis based on the following:
1.
Road improvements are not needed to accommodate the traffic to be generated by the project.
2.
The project takes direct access onto a city road or state highway. A second primary access onto a road that is not a city road or state highway will still require a traffic analysis for that portion of the traffic.
3.
The traffic to be generated does not adversely affect the traffic currently planned for and accommodated within, and adjacent to, the roadways, accesses, and intersections that provide access to the property; acceptable level of service on the adjacent public roadways, accesses, and intersections will be maintained; and no roadway, access, or intersection in the immediate vicinity has a history of safety or accident problems.
B.
The public works director or planning engineer may require traffic analysis to account for system impacts from approved development projects, phasing, or other projects in process concurrently with the county.
C.
The public works director or planning engineer may require an update to a previously submitted traffic analysis if there is an increase in background or project generated traffic or other factors that may impact traffic, level of service, or warrants for road improvements, since the original study was completed that may result in changes in level of service or the need for road improvements.
D.
Phased projects with a multi-year buildout will be required to prepare a master traffic analysis to address overall project impacts and identify key criteria that would warrant construction of road improvements. Unless exempted by paragraph 74-3.IV.A, each site specific development plan shall require a traffic analysis that verifies the accuracy of the original traffic projections, both on-site and background, and examines the warrants for road improvements.
E.
Projected traffic volumes. Both the traffic evaluation and the traffic impact study shall describe projected traffic volumes as follows:
1.
Trip generation values used for calculating ADT shall be primarily based on the type of occupancy for which the development is designed and secondarily based on the occupancy rate and activities generated. Subject to subparagraph 2 below, all uses shall use trip generation values as shown in the most current edition of the Trip Generation Manual, by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, or as verified by other data sources as determined by the public works director or planning engineer. When determining ADT under this subparagraph 1, primary consideration shall be given to the square footage of the proposed development and secondary consideration shall be given to other factors such as occupancy rate and the anticipated number of employees.
2.
For single-family use, multi-family use, and any nonresidential use not subject to subparagraph 1 above, trip generation values used for calculating ADT shall be as follows:

F.
Traffic evaluation. A traffic evaluation is required for projects that do not meet thresholds for a traffic impact study. The traffic evaluation shall:
1.
Quantify volume generated by the development or use
and determine internal road classifications
;
2.
If applicable, quantify off-site traffic volumes on a private road that provides access to a
county road
, state highway, city, or town road. Calculations shall account for future traffic from undeveloped lots at the single-family trip generation rate;
3.
Include entering sight distances for all intersections and accesses serving the project.
4.
Evaluate turn lane warrant based on CDOT Access Code and accounting for proposed and existing traffic volumes. For purposes of determining auxiliary lane warrants according to the current version of the Colorado State Highway Access Code, Volume 2, all county roads shall be considered category R-B unless the public works director determines other categories should be considered due to the densities of access points or because the proposed development or use is adjacent to an incorporated area.
G.
Traffic impact study.
1.
Applicability. A traffic impact study involves a detailed analysis of road conditions, impacts and mitigation. Safety, access, level of service, and off-site impact mitigation are emphasized. A traffic impact study is required when the public works director or planning engineer determines the proposed development or use is anticipated to generate one (1) of the following:
a.
One hundred (100) or more ADT;
b.
A fifty (50) percent or more equivalent single axle load increase on the nearest county road caused by trucks classified by the United States Department of Transportation as Class 6 or higher;
c.
Additional traffic to an existing county road that currently operates, or with the increased traffic due to the development or use will operate, at a level of service less than that described in section 74-2;
d.
Additional traffic to any intersection with an existing peak hour traffic volume that is within ten (10) percent of meeting warrants for auxiliary lanes as determined by the current version of the Colorado State Highway Access Code, Volume 2;
e.
Any increased traffic volume at an intersection or on a roadway with a documented accident history or other known existing safety hazards, as determined by the public works director or planning engineer.
2.
Content requirements. All traffic impact studies shall:
a.
Quantify traffic volume generated by the project at build out and determine internal road classifications;
b.
Include a vicinity map;
c.
Meet the requirements of the current version of the Colorado State Highway Access Code, Volume 2;
d.
Study turning movements and level of service at peak hour for intersections adjacent to the proposed development or use;
e.
Study traffic within the traffic impact area, including turning movements and level of service at peak hour at intersections adjacent to the proposed development or use.
As determined by the planning engineer, the traffic impact area may be reduced or expanded depending on the traffic characteristics of the project, the existing and future land uses, and the road and traffic conditions that are affected by the project
;
f.
If applicable, quantify off-site traffic volumes on private roadways that provide access to a county road, state highway, city, or town road. Calculations shall account for future traffic from undeveloped lots at the single-family trip generation rate;
g.
Include modal split assumptions with analytical support;
h.
Include level of service calculations;
i.
Include entering sight distances for all intersections and accesses serving the project;
j.
Include warrants and design criteria for acceleration and deceleration lanes as required by the current versions of the Colorado State Highway Access Code, Volume 2 and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. For purposes of determining auxiliary lane warrants pursuant to the Colorado State Highway Access Code, Volume 2, all county roads shall be considered category R-B unless the public works director determines other categories should be considered due to the density of access points or because the proposed development is adjacent to an incorporated area;
k.
Include a safety analysis of potential conflict points, turning movements, road alignment, and five (5) years of accident history;
l.
Identify required roadway improvements, including without limitation road width and shoulders, geometry, acceleration and deceleration lanes, and turn lanes, drainage improvements, guardrail, signs, and striping;
m.
Include pavement structural capacity analysis based on a geotechnical study, unless the public works director determines the proposed development’s anticipated traffic represents less than a twenty-five (25) percent increase in ESAL loads;
n.
Identify road maintenance needs and schedule, including without limitation culverts and dust control;
o.
Collect existing traffic counts at the morning and afternoon peak hour traffic times over a minimum of two (2) weekdays, unless the public works director determines that such traffic counts are not needed based on the availability of existing data; traffic counts taken between October and April shall include a seasonal adjustment factor as calculated by CDOT for the region and time of year;
p.
Evaluate current daily peak and peak hour traffic data and twenty (20) year projections including without limitation turning movements at all intersections and key year midpoints assuming a build out of the traffic impact area based on land use, comprehensive plans, and growth estimates;
q.
Include data collection sheets, calculation sheets, and software outputs;
r.
Include a section for conclusions, mitigation and recommendations. This section should describe safety impacts resulting from the development or use, needed actions to mitigate the impacts (both immediately adjacent to the site as well as off-site mitigation measures needed as a direct result of the development or use), and the applicant’s proposed methods and schedule for phased projects to implement the mitigation measures. This section should detail the anticipated site access configuration (driveways, private roadways, paths, sidewalks, etc.) consistent with the requirements of these standards.

V.
Design exceptions
. Aside from LOS standards for existing
county roads
, in certain limited exceptions, it is recognized that a proposed design may deviate from the standards prescribed by the road design publications described in section 74-1 or elsewhere in this chapter. In such instances, the applicant’s or owner’s professional engineer shall document, in writing and with sufficient detail, the cause for such deviation. The rationale for the deviation shall demonstrate that the deviation satisfies all of the following:
A.
Is not likely to compromise public safety;
B.
Is not contrary to best engineering practices as reflected in the road design publications described in section 74-1 or elsewhere in this chapter;
C.
Is not contrary to the intent and general purposes of the code;
D.
Does not result in a significant impact to the public due to maintenance of the improvements;
E.
Is the minimum exception or deviation necessary to afford relief, given the context;
F.
Is reasonably necessary for the health, safety and welfare of the public.
Upon receipt of the written request, the public works director or planning engineer shall evaluate the rationale according to the criteria in this section and advise the applicant’s or owner’s professional engineer whether the deviation, in whole or in part, is acceptable.
If the applicant or owner do not agree with the determination of the public works director or planning engineer or the county attorney determines the request relates to special conditions or exceptional characteristics of the proposal, not created by the applicant, that may justify or require a variance from the strict and literal interpretation of this code’s standards to avoid undue hardship, the applicant or owner shall follow the variance process described in section 66-27.
VI.
Evaluation of development and use proposals.
A.
The following factors shall be considered when evaluating development or use proposals:
1.
Whether the proposal, design, proposed mitigation and construction plans meet the standards set forth in this chapter;
2.
Conformance with the road design publications described in subsection 74-1.III; provided, however, road widths for minor local roads shall be as set forth in this section 74-2;
3.
Whether the proposal will increase ESAL loads by fifty (50) percent or more, and whether the projected traffic loads from the development or use can be accommodated without damaging the roadway or increasing the county’s costs for maintenance;
4.
Whether there have been known safety issues including, but not limited to, road geometry, sight distance, number of accidents or need for emergency access;
5.
Whether the proposal adequately and appropriately mitigates the impacts (both immediately adjacent to the project as well as off-site mitigation measures needed as a direct result of the project), and whether the applicant’s or owner’s proposed methods and schedule for phasing is adequate to implement the mitigation measures.
B.
If the proposal does not meet the standards set forth in this chapter and no design modification would remedy the problems with the proposal, the planning engineer or public works director shall inform the director of such in the referral comments and articulate the specific standards that are not met.
C.
If the development proposal meets the requirements of this chapter but only by including recommended conditions of approval or specific plat notes, the planning engineer or public works director shall provide the necessary conditions of approval or plat notes to the director.
D.
Once submitted to the director, the referral agency comments shall become part of the permanent record and incorporated into the project file. The referral comments shall inform the CDD’s recommendation for project approval or denial to the decision-making body.

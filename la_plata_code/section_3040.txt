District maps.
The boundaries of the
planning districts
are shown on the map entitled Official Development District Map of La Plata County, Colorado. District maps are intended to be part of the

District maps are not intended to reflect zoning of any area of the planning district but may reflect land uses which are consistent with the contents of the district plan. All district plan maps are kept and maintained by the county GIS Department and available as layers in the county’s publicly accessible internet mapping system.
II.
Adoption, amendments or updates of district maps.
District maps may be adopted, amended or updated in the same manner as a district plan.

Chapter 73 Standards and Additional Submittal Requirements for Specific Uses
Overview
The specific uses addressed in this chapter require particular attention for a variety of reasons. Although many uses have the potential to impact neighbors by generating noise, dust, odor, light, traffic or other potential nuisances, some uses require evaluation and mitigation efforts beyond those established more generally elsewhere in the code. By way of example, some uses present additional concerns to the health, safety and welfare of the community at large that justify special attention in this chapter. Other uses addressed in this chapter warrant special attention in order to accommodate unique technical considerations or to coordinate the county’s interests with regulations and standards set at the state and federal levels. Some uses addressed in this chapter present opportunities to promote the county’s interest in the use by allowing different standards than those generally applicable.
Sec. 73-10 Gravel, sand, topsoil and mineral extraction
I.
Purpose.
This section is enacted to facilitate the extraction and processing of gravel, sand, topsoil and minerals, while mitigating potential conflicts between such activities and existing or future land uses, and while protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the people of La Plata County. Upon the county’s adoption of a master plan for the extraction of commercial mineral deposits pursuant to C.R.S. § 34-1-304, this section shall have the additional purpose of protecting and administering commercial mineral deposits to facilitate their exploration and the extraction of minerals therefrom, while allowing other development that will not interfere with the commercial mineral deposits’ exploration and extraction.
II.
Applicability.
These standards and submittal requirements shall apply to land use permit applications proposing the extraction or processing activity related to gravel, sand, topsoil or minerals, excluding oil and natural gas, the extraction of which shall be administered pursuant to chapter 90.
III.
Standards specific to gravel, sand, topsoil and mineral extraction.
A.
Right to extract. Applicants must have the legal right to extract gravel, sand, topsoil or minerals on the site proposed. Where the site in question is a divided estate in which the ownership of mineral rights is separate from ownership of surface rights, the owner of the mineral rights must have the legal right to enter the site and engage in extraction thereon.
B.
Transportation plan. Applicants shall establish a plan for the transportation of extracted gravel, sand, topsoil and minerals off the site of extraction or, if a proposal is for a processing site, a plan for the transportation of processed gravel, sand, topsoil and minerals to and from the site of the processing activity.
C.
Setbacks. The following minimum setbacks shall apply to all facilities located upon or above the surface of land associated with extraction or processing activity related to gravel, sand, topsoil or minerals:

I.
Release.
By accepting a
license
issued pursuant to this article, the licensee releases the
county
, its elected officials, employees, officers, attorneys, and agents from any and all liability for any and all known, unknown or unforeseen damages, injuries, losses and liabilities directly or indirectly related to the licensee’s ownership of, or other interest in, any marijuana operations, including but not limited to any claim that results from any arrest or prosecution of the licensee or its employees, clients or customers, as applicable, for a violation of state or federal law, rules, or regulations.
II.
Indemnification.
By accepting a license issued pursuant to this article, the licensee, jointly and severally, if more than one (1), indemnifies and holds harmless the county, its employees, officers, elected officials, insurers, attorneys and agents from any and all suits, actions, claims, judgments, obligations or liabilities of every nature and description which arise out of or in any manner are connected with the operation of a marijuana business applying for a license or licensed by the county. Furthermore, the licensee agrees to investigate, handle, respond to, and to provide defense for and defend against, any such liability, claims, or demands at its expense, and to bear all other costs and expenses related thereto, including court costs and attorney fees; however, such agreement does not make the licensee an agent or employee of the county.

As of the date this article was enacted and amended, the cultivation, use, possession, distribution and sale of marijuana is illegal under federal law, and any person who engages in such activities does so at their own risk. Any license issued pursuant to this article does not provide any exception, defense or immunity to any person in regard to any potential criminal liability a person may have for the cultivation, use, possession, distribution and sale of marijuana.

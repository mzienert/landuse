CHAPTER 66: PERMITS AND PROCEDURES
Overview
This chapter describes the common procedures for
county
review of all land development activity in the
unincorporated
areas of La Plata County and the specific procedures for the review of
land use permits
and other types of applications.
The provisions common to all permit and
development
review covered in this chapter include, among other things, pre-application procedures, submittal requirements, public notice, scope of
county
review, public meetings and appeals.
This chapter also includes the unique procedural review requirements or steps for most individual types of
land use permit
applications and the rules that will apply to an application once it is approved, such as the life of the
development
approval, expiration, and amendments.
The specific procedural steps for divisions of land are in chapter 67 and for
planned unit developments
in chapter 68.

Sec. 66-1 General applicability
I.
Land use permit required.
Unless otherwise expressly exempt, waived or adjusted by the provisions of this code, all land development in the unincorporated areas of the county, including but not limited to: land subdivision, establishment of new land uses, and changes in land use, shall be subject to a requirement for a land use permit or other land development approval as specified in this code.
II.
Director authority to determine applicable permit procedure
. Where it is unclear what land use permit procedure should apply to a proposed development, or if it is unclear whether a proposed land use or development activity is exempt from the land use permit requirements, the director shall have the authority to determine the applicable county review procedure, if any. The director shall, upon the request of any interested party and under the procedures for a director determination stated in section 66-17, determine which permit procedure, if any, best fits the proposed use or activity. To determine the appropriate permit procedure for a use not clearly or specifically identified in chapter 66, the director shall consider definitions of uses found in chapter 62, chapter 65 for uses located within applicable districts or areas, and the specific use standards stated in chapter 73 and sections 66-3 to 66-8. A proposed use/activity shall be substantially similar to other uses requiring a specific level of permit review (or exempt).
III.
Permit required prior to development activity.
Any applicable land use permits shall be obtained prior to site preparation, excavation, erection, construction, reconstruction, development, redevelopment, occupancy, alteration, relocation, change of use, or intensification of use of any development and/or structure. It shall be unlawful for any person to do or cause any of the above without a required land use permit. The grant of a land use permit for a specific development shall not exempt the development from compliance with any and all applicable state or federal statutory or regulatory requirements, including the issuance of any required state or federal permits.
IV.
Permits denied or withheld.
The decision-making body shall deny and withhold permits or permissions on any new project or application under this code where the applicant or the applicant’s agent has failed or refused to comply with this code.
V.
Increase or decrease in the level of land use permit review.
The director, after a use review under section 66-25, shall have the ability to increase the level of required land use permit where, in the discretion of the director, there appears to be outstanding issues pertaining to compliance with this code, or the public health, safety or welfare. At any time prior to final decision on an application, the director may increase the level of required land use permit where, in the discretion of the director, a different level of permit review is required or a proposal is being used to avoid compliance with otherwise applicable standards or procedures. The director may issue a director determination letter decreasing the level of required land use permit or granting a waiver to any requirement in this code in the following circumstances:
A.
To eliminate a substantial burden on religious exercise as guaranteed by the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000;
B.
To provide reasonable accommodations for protected groups under the federal Fair Housing Act;
C.
To comply with any other state, tribal or federal law.
VI.
Building permits may be required.
The county land use permits identify and allow certain land uses to be undertaken on a property and are separate and distinct from building permits. Issuance of a land use permit does not affect or otherwise supersede the requirement to obtain a building permit for structures pursuant to the county building code, although a building permit may not be required in all cases where a land use permit is issued.
VII.
Representations in applications and hearings.
All representations made in an application for a land use permit, variance, or waiver that are necessary for compliance with any standard are binding. All oral, written and graphic representations made in the course of hearings before the PC, JPC, BOA, board or other appropriate body shall be considered a part of the application. Any false or inaccurate information given in a land use permit or development application, or in other representations to the staff or in the course of a hearing may be grounds for the decision-making body to deny, suspend or withdraw any approval of a plan or plat, or to require that certain corrective measures be taken as described in chapter 80. However, minor defects in information that do not substantively affect the accuracy of the representations made in the application shall not invalidate a permit or approval if the director determines the applicant has made a bona fide attempt to provide truthful, accurate information. The applicant, by accepting the benefits of a permit, also certifies, to the best of their knowledge, that the permit application materials are true and correct.
VIII.
Phased or serial development.
Phased or serial development, whether or not initially disclosed by the applicant, shall not be used to circumvent or avoid compliance with this code. For any phases or potential serial development, the director may recommend to the decision-making body conditions of approval that document baseline conditions and require applicants for subsequent phases or serial development to analyze and comply with code standards based on the projected cumulative impacts of all phases of the development. For subsequent phases or serial developments, including developments in which an initial phase was not analyzed or approved as an initial phase of a multi-phase or serial development, the director may recommend to the decision-making body that the cumulative impacts of the entire phased project or serial development be analyzed to determine the appropriate improvements, mitigation, conditions or other factors affecting all or any portion of the cumulative development's compliance with this code.
IX.
Uses with minimum acreage qualifications.
Except in instances where the reduced acreage is due to condemnation (or sold under circumstances where condemnation is legally permissible), any use permitted on a parcel subject to meeting minimum acreage qualifications shall maintain such minimum acreage as a condition of the permit. In the event the area of the parcel is reduced in area below the minimum qualifying acreage, the reduction shall be considered a violation of this code and subject to the provisions of chapter 80 unless a new land use permit, if any is available under the code, is obtained.

II.
AgPlus uses not requiring a land use permit.
A.
Purpose. This subsection 66-3.II. and subsection 66-5.II. below address a unique set of uses by right and types of administrative land use permits specifically related to agriculture. Historically, agriculture has been the predominant land use in the unincorporated areas of La Plata County. Agriculture has defined the area’s character and agricultural enterprises and activities are an important sector of the county’s economy. While rural living is a life-style choice for many residents, some generate a considerable portion, if not all of their livelihood from agriculture. An important component of agriculture is the production of commodities produced and sold on the farm or sold from the farm to be processed elsewhere. Key policy goals of several district plans and this code are to encourage, promote and foster agricultural enterprises and activities in the county. It is for these reasons and others that uses referred to as AgPlus are addressed in this chapter. In this context “plus” is a qualitative rather than a quantitative measure, the objective being the preservation of agricultural lands by focusing on the use to which a parcel may be put plus any “value added” activities that support the agricultural use or the ability of the property owner to sustain the land for agricultural purposes.
B.
Applicability. This subsection applies to uses by right which the county has determined are customarily incidental or directly related to a pre-existing agricultural activity conducted on a single agricultural parcel. The second type, addressed in subsection 66-5.II., are AgPlus uses that require administrative review because such uses are secondary and clearly subordinate to the pre-existing agricultural activity conducted on the agricultural parcel but support the sustainability of the agricultural use. To qualify for either type of AgPlus use, the proposed use must occur on a single agricultural parcel meeting the following criteria:
1.
The parcel was classified by the county assessor as agricultural in the previous two (2) years and is presently used for agricultural purposes;
2.
Except for accessory rural occupations, home occupations, direct market business / community supported agriculture, or farm stands, the parcel is a minimum of fifteen (15) acres;
3.
The parcel subject to the application shall not be in violation of this code or the building code.
C.
Uses by right. Uses in this paragraph shall be considered uses by right not requiring a land use permit:
1.
Agricultural research facility;
2.
Accessory rural occupation or home occupation;
3.
Equine or llama activities;
4.
Direct market business/community supported agriculture; and
5.
Farm machinery repair.
III.
Minimum requirements.
Development not requiring a county land use permit as specified in this code, shall meet all applicable established minimum requirements, including, but not limited to the following:
A.
Building permits required as applicable;
B.
Compliance with all applicable site development standards, such as setbacks and parking, and all use provisions specified in this code;
C.
The director may require compliance with section 81-2 Sections Necessary for Immediate Preservation of Public Health and Safety when circumstances warrant.
IV.
Building permit referral.
Building permit applications shall be referred to the CDD for review of compliance with the standards of this code. CDD review shall include but is not limited to: compliance with the land use permit and division of land requirements of Chapters 66 and 67, development on a legal lot of record, setbacks within section 70-6 and Chapter 90, and the height requirements of sections 65-6 and 70-6. Building permit applications shall include a site plan and any other documentation that contains all information needed to demonstrate compliance with applicable standards. Referral to the CDD is not intended to preclude or conflict with the applicability of the building code or other sections of the code.

Sec. 66-10 Pre-application process
I.
Purpose.
The purpose of the pre-application process is to provide an opportunity for the applicant and the county to discuss the development proposal in order to:
A.
Determine the required application(s) and the timing of multiple application submittals including whether they may be processed concurrently or must be processed sequentially;
B.
Provide the applicant with application materials and inform the applicant of submittal requirements and an approximate time frame for the application review process;
C.
Discuss compliance with the code’s land use, density, and development standards, and attempt to identify potentially significant issues regarding compliance early in the process;
D.
Refer the applicant to other departments or agencies to discuss significant issues prior to the pre-application meeting and application submittal;
E.
Discuss the extent to which surrounding landowners are to be notified of the proposal and the need for any neighborhood meetings.
II.
Process and requirements.
A.
Request for a pre-application meeting and preliminary project feasibility.  To request a pre-application meeting, the applicant shall submit a preliminary site plan, a written description of the proposal, and all completed forms or information as required by the director.  Materials submitted for review as part of the pre-application process are not an “application” for development.  The director shall review the information provided by the applicant in order to determine the appropriate type of application process and to identify potential development issues.  Prior to scheduling a pre-application meeting, the director may refer the applicant to other departments or agencies, surrounding landowners or other parties to explore identified potential issues and to obtain additional information which may assist the applicant in determining the preliminary feasibility of the proposal.
B.
Alternative pre-application process.  For director determinations, administrative land use permits and other types of administrative applications, the director may establish alternatives to the procedures outlined in this section for the applicant to obtain a list of application requirements and the appropriate forms in order to expedite the process.
C.
Pre-application meeting. Unless otherwise provided in this code, a pre-application meeting is required for the specific land use permit and development applications shown in Table 66-15.  For all application types, a conference through telephone, video, email or other electronic means may serve the function of a meeting at the discretion of the director.  The pre-application meeting shall occur prior to the filing of the formal application.  The director shall provide the applicant:
1.
A checklist of submittal items that will be necessary for each type of application being sought;
2.
The forms with the specific information that is required to process each type of application being sought;
3.
The county’s applicable application fee(s).
D.
Attendance. At a minimum, the applicant and the director shall participate in the pre-application meeting.  The director may invite other county staff or agency representatives to participate in the pre-application meeting.
E.
Effect of the pre-application meeting. The director and other staff opinions presented during the pre-application process are informational only and do not represent a commitment on behalf of the county regarding the acceptability of the development proposal.  Comments made by staff should be considered to be preliminary until after the application is submitted and surrounding landowners and referral agencies have had an opportunity to comment.
F.
Timely application submittal required. If a development application is not submitted within six (6) months of a pre-application meeting, the applicant shall schedule and attend another pre-application meeting before submitting an application.  The director may waive another pre-application meeting if determined that it is not necessary for adequate project review or if there has been no substantial change in the proposal.

3.
Referral agency fees. Other outside referral agencies may require review fees and the applicant shall pay those fees directly to the referral agencies in advance of their review and comment.
F.
Applicant responsible for reimbursing county for consultant review fees.
1.
Consultant review authorized. The director is authorized to retain professional consultants at the applicant's expense to assist in the review of proposed development. The director may make an initial determination as to the use of consultants at the time of the pre-application meeting and may revise the determination if new or changed information in the application materials justifies the revision.  The selection of the consultant shall be within the sole discretion of the director.
2.
Payment of consultant review fee. If, at any point in the review process, the director determines an application will require review by professional consultants the applicant shall be responsible for all costs associated with the consultants’ review or support services.  Such consultants or support services may include, but are not limited to: fees or costs for technical consultants, expert witnesses, engineers, attorneys, court reporters, or transcription fees. The director shall provide the applicant with a written preliminary estimate of anticipated services or professional consultant review or service fees, whether fixed or at an hourly rate.   Not later than twenty (20) days following receipt of the director’s estimate, the applicant shall present to the director certified funds in the amount set, whether as payment in whole or as a deposit. Generally, the amount set shall be one hundred (100) percent of the estimated service or review fees.  Regardless of such estimate, the applicant shall be responsible for all service or consultant review fees.  As review of the application progresses, if necessary, the applicant shall replenish the fee account to ensure that funds are available to continue to meet the costs of county review or services related to the decision-making process, including costs incurred by the county during any appeal process.  Until the fee is paid or replenished as necessary, the application shall not be further processed.

Fixed-fee consultant review. The director is authorized to establish:
a.
A roster of consultants that are pre-qualified to conduct reviews of various types;
b.
A schedule of fixed fees.
G.
Concurrent review.  At the election of the applicant, and with the director’s approval, different types of applications may be consolidated or processed concurrently whenever possible to expedite total review and processing time for a project.  The time frame and approval process for consolidated or concurrently reviewed applications shall follow the longest time frame and approval process required for the subject application types.  In no event shall two (2) mutually exclusive applications be processed concurrently.  The submission of multiple applications for the same property is a good faith representation that the applicant intends to pursue both projects, if approved.

B.
Referral to agencies.
1.
Referral to appropriate agencies.  The county does not provide services such as fire protection, water supply and sanitary sewage treatment, health inspections or schools.  Development proposals can impact the agencies providing these services and the county relies on these agencies to identify development requirements and provide comments through the referral process.  Upon acceptance of an application, the director shall distribute pertinent materials from the application to the appropriate agencies as dictated by specific provisions in this code or by the director when determined to be necessary to ensure that the proposal complies with all applicable standards and requirements.  Referral agencies include the following:

5.
Time frame for review. Referral agencies and departments shall submit their comments to the director within twenty-one (21) days of the agency’s receipt of the referral packet. If no comments are received, the referral agency, organization, or individual shall be deemed to have waived the right to submit comment unless such comments are otherwise needed to demonstrate compliance with a requirement of this code or state statute. Staff may grant a necessary extension of up to thirty (30) additional days for an agency’s review and comments, with the applicant’s consent. Staff will reasonably attempt to incorporate late comments into the staff report.
6.
Additional review. During the review of an application, the director may require that the applicant solicit additional comments regarding a project from the appropriate agencies if the director determines that the applicant did not adequately address an agency’s original comment or if the application is revised.
7.
Alternative agency comment procedures. For director determinations, administrative land use permits and other types of administrative applications, the director may establish alternative procedures for the applicant to obtain agency comments, signatures or certifications in order to expedite the review of the application.
8.
The applicant shall respond to and remedy all concerns, deficiencies and recommendations necessary to comply with the requirements of this code set forth in the referral responses received and shall submit such responses to the CDD. If the applicant fails to submit a thorough response within sixty (60) days and has not communicated just cause for delay to the director, then the application shall be considered withdrawn by the applicant.
C.
Compliance review of application.
1.
Staff shall review the application for compliance with all applicable approval criteria and use, density, and development standards contained in this code and other applicable law.  Within fifteen (15) business days of the end of the time frame for agency review, staff shall conclude the compliance review of the application and notify the applicant of the results in writing.  The time frame for review may be extended by staff pursuant to paragraph 66-12.III.B. An application shall be considered compliant if the information contained in the application demonstrates that the proposed development is ripe for consideration of compliance with this code’s requirement.  Any and all approvals for variances or waivers to required standards except those reviewed by the board shall be obtained prior to the processing of any project to the PC or board.  If after an application has been submitted, the director determines that a variance or waiver is necessary, the application shall be held in abeyance until such variance or waiver is approved.
2.
If staff’s compliance review identifies areas where the application does not demonstrate that the proposed development complies with this code’s requirements and is determined to be non-compliant, staff’s notification to the applicant shall specifically identify those items and associated code provisions. The applicant shall have an opportunity to revise the application materials.  Revisions, additions and corrections to application materials in response to staff’s compliance review shall be re-submitted within a time frame specified by staff.  The time frame specified by staff shall not be less than thirty (30) days, and the re-submittal shall be subject to the application submission, agency referral and staff review provisions of this code section.

If the applicant does not rectify the deficiencies within a sixty (60) day period immediately following the date of the occurrences outlined in subparagraphs 66-11.III.A.1 through 3, the application shall be considered automatically withdrawn.  Prior to the date on which the application is deemed withdrawn, the director may extend the specified time frame should the director determine that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant prevent timely completion of the application.
C.
Re-submittal of automatically withdrawn application.  Any re-submittal of an automatically withdrawn application requires a new application, beginning with the pre-application process.
IV.
Neighborhood meetings.
A.
Purpose.  The county encourages and may require informal neighborhood meetings between applicants and potentially affected landowners and residents to facilitate public input to land use decisions early in the review process.  A neighborhood meeting is not a public hearing.
B.
Applicability.  Neighborhood meetings may be required by the director for the types of applications as specified in Table 66-15.
C.
Neighborhood meeting procedures.

Following the applicant's presentation, the neighbors may comment on the proposed project or question the applicant on issues presented and the impacts of the use on the neighborhood.
Discussion between the applicant and neighbors to resolve questions and concerns is encouraged.
5.
Staff shall prepare a report summarizing the discussion points from the neighborhood meeting which shall be included with the staff report for any subsequent public meetings.
6.
An applicant's failure to attend any required neighborhood meetings may delay review of the application or result in an inactive application under subsection 66-11.III.
7.
If no surrounding landowner attends the neighborhood meeting for which proper notice was given, the applicant shall have satisfied the requirements for that neighborhood meeting.
V.
Staff report and recommendation.
A.
Preparation of staff report and recommendation. Unless the application is one that is approved by a director determination letter, following the compliance review of the application, including the period for the applicant's response to any noncompliance matters, staff shall prepare a written staff report.  The report shall include discussion of the relevant issues pertaining to the compliance of the application with the standards and approval criteria of this code.  The staff report shall incorporate public comments, the relevant comments from referral agencies and any other relevant information concerning the application.  The staff report shall conclude with a recommendation for application approval, approval with conditions, or denial. Conditions for approval may be recommended to eliminate any areas of noncompliance, ensure compatibility or to mitigate any adverse impacts from the development proposal.
B.
Consent agenda placement. If an application meets or exceeds all required standards and procedures or will meet all requirements with staff recommended conditions, and the director recommends approval or approval with any such conditions, the director may place the application on the PC’s or board’s consent agenda.  At the public meeting, the PC or board may approve such consent agenda with a single motion, or a member may move to place consideration of the project on the decision agenda for project specific review.  Any member of the public, applicant, or staff may also request project specific review and, subject to an affirmative vote of the decision-making body, the project may be moved to the decision agenda for project specific review and consideration.  If an application fails to meet or exceed all required standards, requirements, and procedures and the director recommends denial, the director shall place the application on the PC’s or board’s decision agenda.
C.
Distribution of staff report.  Staff shall distribute the staff report to the applicant, review or decision-making body, and county attorney and shall also make the staff report available to any interested parties and members of the public prior to the scheduled meeting date.

The board’s consideration of the application shall be de novo and staff shall distribute the staff report and recommendations as well as notice the public meeting pursuant to subsection 66-14.IV. At the meeting the board may:
i. Approve the application;
ii. Approve the application with conditions;
iii. Request more or additional information and continue the meeting to a date certain for a decision, subject to any statutory time limits;
iv. Take the application under advisement and continue to a date certain for a decision, subject to any statutory time limits;

If a written transcript of the decision-making body’s meeting at which the final decision was made is required, the appellant shall pay the costs of preparation of the record and the transcript.
III.
Vested rights.
A.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish a system of vested property rights for these land use regulations, as authorized by C.R.S. § 24-68-101
et seq.
B.
Establishment.
1.
General. A vested property right shall be deemed established for a land use permit with the approval of a site specific development plan. Such vested property right shall attach to and run with the land for which the land use permit is approved and shall confer upon the real property owner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of the real property under the terms and conditions of the site specific development plan for a period of three (3) years from the date of its approval.
2.
Site specific development plan. For the purposes of this section, site specific development plan shall only mean:
a.
Administrative land use permit: all developments except for special events;
b.
Minor land use permit: all developments except for temporary uses;
c.
Major land use permit: all developments except for sketch plans and preliminary plans and plats;
d.
Minor and major oil and gas permits, subject to paragraph 90-4.I.C.
C.
Duration and termination.
1.
Duration. A vested property right as defined by this section shall be deemed effective as of the date on which the decision-making body approves the site specific development plan and shall remain effective for a period of three (3) years. If upon expiration of the vesting period, the approved use has not commenced or the approved development has not been constructed, the approval shall be deemed expired. The three (3) year vesting period shall not be extended by amendments to a site specific development plan, unless expressly authorized by the board. Such approval shall be subject to all rights of judicial review; except the period permitted by law for the exercise of such rights shall not begin to run until the date of publication of a notice advising the general public of the approval. Publication shall be done by the CDD once in a newspaper of general circulation not more than fourteen (14) days after the date of final approval.
2.
Forfeiture. Failure to abide by any applicable terms and conditions attached to the site specific development plan shall result in immediate forfeiture of the vested property right.
3.
Extensions. The board may, as a legislative act, enter into a development agreement with a real property owner that provides that property rights shall be vested for a period exceeding three (3) years where it is warranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the size and phasing of the development, economic cycles and market conditions.
4.
Subsequent review and approval. Following approval or conditional approval of a site specific development plan, nothing in this section shall exempt the site specific development plan from subsequent reviews by the county to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, if such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the original approval.
D.
Exceptions. A vested property right, once established pursuant to this section precludes land use regulations adopted by the county for a three (3) year period of time from the date of approval of the site specific development plan, that would alter, impair, prevent, diminish or otherwise delay the development or use of the real property subject to the site specific development plan except:
1.
Property owner’s consent. With the consent of the affected real property owner.
2.
Hazards. Upon the discovery of natural hazards or human made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the subject property, which hazards could not reasonably have been discovered or did not exist at the time of the approval of the site specific development plan, and which hazards, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health and safety pursuant to section 81-2 Sections Necessary for Immediate Preservation of Public Health and Safety.
E.
Effect of expiration or termination on public lands. The expiration or termination of a vested property right shall have no effect upon publicly dedicated lands or rights-of-way dedicated with respect to such property.
IV.
Permit to be available for inspection.
Upon receipt of a land use permit required by this code, the holder of the permit shall keep a copy of the permit available for inspection, upon request, to be located on the subject site.

I.
Applicability.
Unless otherwise specified,
county
review bodies
and
decision-making bodies
shall review all
land use permit
and
development
applications, including without limitation requests for
director determinations
, submitted pursuant to this
code
for compliance with the general approval criteria stated in this section. The application may also be subject to additional approval criteria and standards specific to the type of application. In case of conflict between a specific approval criterion stated and the general approval criteria stated in this section, the specific approval criterion shall apply.

Sec. 66-19 Sketch plan
I.
Purpose
. A sketch plan provides an opportunity for the county, the applicant, and the public to evaluate and discuss the basic design, concept and suitability of the project and to consider if the project is capable of substantially complying with this code and in general conformance with the comprehensive plan. Where appropriate, the sketch plan process may also examine alternative approaches to development of the property. Typically, a proposal will evolve during sketch plan review. To encourage the consideration of alternatives where appropriate and to allow the sketch plan to evolve, detailed engineering plans and other overly detailed information shall not be required nor accepted by the county. A sketch plan may be an optional or required step in some land use permit and development processes.
II.
Common procedures.
Figure 66-19 below identifies the application steps that apply to the review of a sketch plan.
III.
Approval criteria.
All sketch plans shall be reviewed for general consistency with the general approval criteria stated in section 66-16, but not for detailed compliance with development standards referenced in such criteria. The review for general consistency shall include a review of the applicant’s concepts for mitigating potential effects expected to be produced by the proposed development in relationship to the general approval criteria. The application may also be subject to additional approval criteria specific to the type of application.
IV.
Sketch plan review and considerations.
At sketch plan, the decision-making body shall determine whether the proposed sketch plan substantially complies with this code and is in general conformance with the comprehensive plan. The decision-making body shall consider matters such as, but not limited to, the following:
A.
The types of use;
B.
The general locations intended for development and the areas planned to remain undeveloped, including open space;
C.
The general plan for phasing of the development and any infrastructure or other improvements;
D.
The general alignment for access;
E.
The provision of an adequate water supply and whether the water supply and sewage disposal will be provided through on-site water and wastewater treatment systems or through connection to public systems;
F.
Compatibility with the natural environment and the way natural hazards will not be increased as a result of the development;
G.
Compatibility with the existing uses of adjacent properties and other lands that may be significantly impacted.
V.
Submittal requirements.
In addition to the general land use permit application submittal requirements set forth in section 66-11, applicants proposing a sketch plan shall submit the following:
A.
A sketch plan drawing on one (1) or more sheets illustrating the entire development. Detailed engineering plans and other detailed information shall not be required nor accepted by the county. The sketch plan shall be conceptual in nature and, at a minimum, include the following information:
1.
Uses proposed;
2.
Intensity or density of uses proposed;
3.
Proposed arrangement of lots;
4.
Location of open space;
5.
Location of existing and proposed buildings on the site;
6.
Conceptual layout of road, street, utilities, drainage and pedestrian facilities existing and proposed.
7.
The proposed development phases.
B.
If phasing is proposed, a phasing plan consisting of a written description of each of the proposed phases indicating the type of development and the infrastructure improvements necessary for each phase. This may be included as part of the narrative for the project application.
C.
Mitigation concepts for mitigating potential adverse effects produced by the proposed development. These concepts shall be illustrated on the plan drawing(s) or described in writing, or both. The written description may be included as part of the narrative for the project application.
VI.
Sketch plan outcome.
The outcome of sketch plan review should be an identification of issues and concerns the applicant must address for the project to be considered ripe for review by the decision-making body.
VII.
Effect of approval of sketch plan.
A.
Limitation on approval. Approval of a sketch plan shall authorize the applicant to submit to the CDD an application for a minor land use permit or in the case of a major land use permit, a preliminary plan. It shall not constitute final approval. Sketch plan approval vests no development rights.
B.
Expiration of approval. Approval of the sketch plan shall be null and void and automatically revoked unless, within one (1) year after the date of approval of the sketch plan, an application for a minor land use permit or in the case of a major land use permit, a preliminary plan is submitted to the CDD and deemed complete by the director.
C.
Extension of sketch plan approval. One (1) extension of time up to one (1) year may be approved by the director upon written request with good cause shown or due to unforeseen circumstances. The owner shall submit a written request for extension to the CDD no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date the sketch plan is set to expire.
VIII.
Modification of an approved sketch plan.
An approved sketch plan shall not be materially altered, changed or otherwise modified except through the approval of a new sketch plan application. An applicant shall apply for an amendment to an approved sketch plan prior to submittal of an application for any land use permit requiring sketch plan approval. If, in the course of staff’s compliance review of a land use permit requiring sketch plan approval, the director determines the preliminary plan or plat is no longer materially consistent with the approved sketch plan, the director shall notify the applicant in writing. If the applicant fails to amend the approved sketch plan, the application may be subject to remand by the board to the planning commission pursuant to section 66-16.

Sec. 66-20 Minor land use permit procedures
I.
Applicability.
Section 66-6 establishes the land uses and development activities that are subject to approval of a minor land use permit. A sketch plan pursuant to section 66-19 for a proposed development is an optional step and may precede an application for a minor land use permit. A sketch plan is a conceptual level to evaluate the basic design and suitability of the project. The minor land use permit requires the submittal of detailed engineered plans and exact locations of all activities and uses.

Sec. 66-21 Major land use permit procedures
I.
Applicability.
Section 66-7 establishes the land uses and
development
activities that are subject to a major
land use permit
. Major
land use permit
projects require consideration by the
county
of a
sketch plan
, preliminary plan, and final plan, in that order. Unless a phasing plan was approved as part of a
sketch plan
, a conceptual
development
plan as provided in section 66-29 is required when
development
is proposed in phases and may be processed concurrently with the first phase of the preliminary plan. Each step is a distinct process involving the submittal of an application, an application fee, required plans and reports, referrals of the proposal to other agencies,
staff
analysis, work sessions and public meetings. At each step of the process, the design and engineering detail increases in order to relieve the
applicant
from major and potentially unnecessary expenses in situations that may require a redesign and a revision of expensive engineering or planning reports. Approval of any application in the process does not ensure approval of the next application. Figure 66-21 A below provides an overview of the applications that are required for the review of major
land use permits
.
II.
Common procedures for major land use permit preliminary plan.
Figure 66-21 B below identifies the application steps that apply to the review of a preliminary plan.
III.
Lapse of approval.
A.
Lapse of approvals. An approved sketch plan shall lapse and be of no further force and effect if the applicant fails to submit the preliminary plan within one (1) year of the date of the sketch plan approval by the PC. An approved preliminary plan shall lapse and be of no further force and effect if the applicant fails to submit the final plan within one (1) year of the date of the preliminary plan approval by the board.
B.
Lapse of phased elements. If the approved preliminary plan provides for phasing of final plan approvals, failure to obtain approval of a final plan for any phase within the time specified in the approved phasing plan shall result in a lapse of the preliminary plan. For phased projects, an approved final plan for any phase of the preliminary plan shall extend the life of the preliminary plan according to the approved phasing plan, or if not specified in an approved phasing plan, for an additional one (1) year from the date the most recent final plan was approved. If successive final plans are not submitted within this one (1) year period, or within the period specified in an approved phasing plan, then the preliminary plan approval shall lapse and be of no further force or effect for those portions of the subject property not covered by an approved final plan.

Applications for joint planning area development shall be referred to the city for a determination on eligibility for annexation and central water service. The city shall have thirty (30) days to review and comment on annexation eligibility and central water service.
2.
Eligible properties. If the property is eligible for annexation, the application for joint planning area development shall not be processed by the CDD until it receives written notice from the city that:
a.
The owner of the property subject to the application does not desire annexation and there is no other basis for involuntary annexation under C.R.S. § 31-12-107;
b.
The city does not desire to annex the subject property;
c.
Annexation of the subject property has been denied;
d.
The city did not receive comment on eligibility within the time frame referenced in subparagraph 66-23.IV.A.1. above; or

When a determination is made that annexation or an implied consent agreement is required, an applicant may request an annexation or implied consent review if the applicant is unable to agree to the terms proposed by the city in an annexation or implied consent agreement. A review request shall be submitted to the director in writing and explain the key provisions in the proposed agreement and why such agreement cannot be achieved. A meeting shall be set before the joint planning commission for review of the agreement within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of the letter. The JPC shall review the applicant's submittals and shall make a determination of whether the city is proposing requirements in the agreement that exceed the then current city development standards and land use code.
B.
Determinations. If a determination is made that the proposed requirements in the agreement do not exceed city development standards and land use code, the applicant shall be required to either annex or enter into the proposed implied consent agreement according to the proposed terms required by the city. If it is determined that such standards have been exceeded, the JPC's determination shall set forth in writing and with specificity the nature and extent of the proposed requirements that exceed the current development standards and land use code. The city shall have twenty-one (21) days after the decision to determine if it is willing to bring the requirements into compliance with the then current city development standards and land use code. If the city does not modify its proposed agreement as required by the JPC, annexation or an implied consent agreement shall no longer be required and the joint planning area development application may be processed with the removal of the requirement that the proposed public water system demonstrate compatibility pursuant to section 70-5. However, the applicant shall still demonstrate the public water system satisfies the requirements of section 70-4.

Sec. 66-27 Variances
I.
Purpose and applicability.
Variances
are intended to alleviate exceptional practical difficulties or undue hardship arising from the strict application of the provisions of this
code
to a specific property.
Variances
address extraordinary, exceptional, or unique situations that were not caused by the
applicant’s
act or omission. Relief in the form of a
variance
, however, shall not have the effect of nullifying or impairing the intent and purpose of this
code
. A
variance
shall not be granted to allow a use not permitted, or a use expressly or by implication prohibited, under the terms of this
code
for the subject property. In addition, a
variance
shall not be granted to allow a greater
density
or intensity of
use
than allowed under the terms of this
code
for the subject property. The BOA shall hear
variances
from the specific terms of this
code
.
II.
Procedures.
Figure 66-27 below identifies the application steps that apply to the review of variances.
Figure 66-27: Summary of Variance Procedures
III.
Approval criteria.
A.
No
variance
allowed. The BOA shall not grant a
variance
to this
code
which allows:
1.
The
alteration
of any definition;
2.
A substantial modification to any
planned unit development
approved by the
board
;
3.
A decrease in the spacing requirements for a
marijuana facility
set forth in section 73-14.
B.
To allow a
variance
from the provisions of this
code
, the BOA shall find all the following:
1.
Hardship. Specific
development
standards, applied to the property in question, create an unnecessary, nonmonetary hardship for the
owner
, as distinguished from an inconvenience, financial hardship or self-imposed hardship.
2.
Special circumstances. Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land and facilities involved and are not applicable to other lands and facilities. The special conditions do not result from the actions of the
applicant
or a previous
owner
of the subject property.
3.
No special privilege. Granting the
variance
will not confer on the
applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this
code
to other lands or facilities.
4.
Comparison with other properties. The literal interpretation of the provisions of this
code
would deprive the
applicant
of rights commonly enjoyed by other similarly situated properties.
5.
Variance
minimum. The
variance
granted is the minimum
variance
possible to make reasonable use of the land or facilities.
6.
Conforms with goals and purpose. The granting of the
variance
will be in harmony with the general goals and purpose of this
code
.
7.
Not injurious to public. The
variance
will not be injurious to the neighborhood involved or detrimental to the public welfare, require extraordinary public expense, or create nuisances.
IV.
Effect of approval.
A.
General rule. Unless otherwise provided by the
decision-making body
, the
applicant
shall apply for any needed
land use permits
or
building permits
within six (6) months of the approval of the
variance
. The
variance
approval shall automatically lapse and be of no further force and effect if the
applicant
fails to obtain all necessary permits within a one (1) year period or if such permits are denied.
B.
Variances granted as part of
development
application. The approval period of any
variance
granted prior to or concurrently with the
county’s
approval of a
land use permit
or
development
application shall be the same as the approval period of the permit or
development
application and shall lapse with the approved permit or
development
application.
C.
Approved variances and redevelopment of the property. The
variance
approval shall automatically lapse and be of no further force and effect if redevelopment of the subject property makes compliance with this
code
possible without the previously approved
variance
.

Sec. 66-29 Conceptual development plans
I.
Purpose and applicability.
A conceptual development plan is designed to accommodate the needs of applicants proposing multi-phased projects. The intent of a CDP is to allow early review of the phasing of a proposed major development. A CDP is required for any major land use permit or major subdivision project where the proposed development or subdivision will be accomplished in multiple phases unless a phasing plan is approved as part of a sketch plan. A CDP shall be submitted prior to or concurrently with the preliminary plan or plat of the first phase of the project. The CDP procedure also ensures that each phase of a multi-phased project contains the facilities and improvements that are necessary to serve the development.
A CDP is a generalized plan that illustrates the amount and types of uses, densities, and proposed vehicle and pedestrian circulation systems within and leading to the proposed development site. Approval of a CDP results in a generalized land use plan for the area proposed to be developed. However, approval of a CDP does not result in final planning approval for the proposed property, and grading, building, and construction permits may not be issued based on an approved CDP. Because the CDP only requires the applicant to prepare conceptual mitigation measures for design or engineering documents, submittal requirements for a CDP shall not constitute an application for purposes of vested rights (section 66-13) or C.R.S. § 24-68-101 et seq.
II.
Procedures for review of conceptual development plan.
Figure 66-29 below identifies the application steps that apply to the review of conceptual development plan.
III.
Approval criteria.
All applications for a CDP shall be reviewed for general consistency with the general approval criteria stated in section 66-16, but not for detailed compliance with development standards referenced in such criteria. The review for general consistency shall include a review of the applicant’s concepts for mitigating potential effects expected to be produced by the proposed development in relationship to the general approval criteria. For example, proof of adequate water, sewer and access shall not be necessary; however, the application shall provide mitigation measures which could be utilized to offset expected demands and impacts based on the proposed uses such as documenting the available capacity of central water or sewer providers, the availability of well permits or describing how road improvements will be provided based on the condition of existing access.
IV.
Submittal requirements.
In addition to the general land use permit application submittal requirements set forth in section 66-11, applicants proposing a CDP shall also submit the following:
A.
A conceptual development plan drawing on one (1) or more sheets illustrating the entire development, conceptual in nature, and at a minimum, including the following information prepared by qualified professionals with experience in land use, transportation, and utility planning and engineering:
1.
Uses proposed;
2.
Intensity or density of uses proposed;
3.
Proposed arrangement of lots;
4.
Location of open space;
5.
Location of existing and proposed buildings on the site;
6.
Road, street, drainage and pedestrian facilities existing and proposed;
7.
Existing or proposed utilities for the development;
8.
The proposed development phases.
B.
A phasing plan consisting of a written description of each of the proposed phases indicating the type of development and the infrastructure improvements necessary for each phase. This may be included as part of the narrative for the project application.
C.
Mitigation concepts for mitigating potential adverse effects produced by the proposed development. These concepts shall be illustrated on the plan drawing(s) or described in writing, or both. The written description may be included as part of the narrative for the project application.
V.
Effect of approval.
A.
Not a site specific development plan. An approved CDP does not constitute a "site specific development plan".
B.
Effect of approval. Approval of a CDP indicates those aspects of the proposed development shown on the plan are generally approved, subject, however, to subsequent consideration and review of a major subdivision or permit for all or a portion of the property, in one (1) or more phases, including conforming to all applicable development standards adopted by the county at the time such subsequent application is submitted.
C.
Lapse of CDP approval. An approved CDP shall lapse and be of no further force and effect if an application for subdivision or development of at least the first phase of the CDP has not been submitted within three (3) years of the CDP approval, unless otherwise specified by the county in its approval of the CDP or phasing plan. Provided such application is submitted within the applicable time period, the term of approval for the remainder of property subject to the CDP shall be extended for an additional three (3) years or as otherwise specified in the approved phasing plan. If the CDP lapses, a new CDP shall be required prior to future development of the subject parcel. Such new CDP shall be processed according to the procedures of this section. Adjustments or modifications to the CDP do not affect the original approval period, unless otherwise provided.
VI.
Modifications to an approved CDP
. Unless qualifying for a permit adjustment pursuant to section 66-26, no CDP shall be altered, changed, or otherwise modified except through the approval of a new CDP application. An applicant shall apply for an amendment to an approved CDP prior to the submittal of applications to commence development of any phase, or prior to the submittal of a preliminary plat, where the proposed phase of development or plat does not conform to the approved CDP.

Sec. 66-30 Development improvements agreement
I.
Applicability.
An applicant whose development requires public improvements but who chooses to not construct and complete all such improvements prior to recordation of the plat or issuance of the land use permit shall enter into a development improvements agreement and shall guarantee that such improvements will be constructed in conformance with approved site plans and permits by delivering to the county an irrevocable letter of credit or other sufficient financial commitment approved by the board. The county may also require a DIA and/or performance guarantees for private or common area improvements, including but not limited to on-site landscaping or restoration of preserved natural areas.
II.
Procedures.
A.
Submittal of cost of improvements worksheet. Prior to execution of agreement and submittal of performance guarantee, the applicant shall submit a detailed cost-of-improvements worksheet prepared by a professional engineer or other qualified professionals, as allowed by the director. The worksheet shall contain a breakdown of the costs of the improvements, utilizing unit prices. Persons designated by the board shall review the proposed costs and approve or disapprove the estimates of cost. For work to be accepted by a special district, the district shall review and approve or disapprove the estimates of cost. In the event of disagreement between the applicant and the county or special district, standard industry resources such as RS Means, CDOT's cost data books or relevant bid tabulations compiled by local area governments or businesses through a competitive bidding process within the preceding twelve (12) months shall be consulted and shall establish the standards by which the reasonableness of the estimates are determined. The worksheet shall be signed by both the applicant and the reviewer. The county reserves the right to review and adjust the cost estimates at any time before or after the applicant delivers its performance guarantee. Adjusted cost estimates will be made according to changes in the Construction Cost Index as published by the Engineering News Record. If the county adjusts cost estimates for the improvements, the county shall give written notice to the applicant. The applicant shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, provide the county with a new or supplemental letter of credit for one hundred twenty (120) percent of the adjusted cost estimate.
B.
Submittal of agreement and performance guarantee. The applicant shall deliver an executed DIA and the required performance guarantee after approval of the plat or permit by the board but before recordation of the plat.
1.
Agreement specifics. The board approves standardized DIAs which may be entered into on behalf of the board by and through the county manager.
2.
Performance guarantee specifics; applicant submits evidence of financial resources. The applicant shall submit satisfactory evidence of adequate financial resources to develop and complete improvements proposed or represented to the board. The applicant shall provide an irrevocable letter of credit or other financial commitment deemed sufficient by the board to ensure that any required public improvements shall be completed or reclaimed as proposed. The letter of credit or financial commitment shall be retained by the county for safekeeping. The letter of credit or other financial commitment shall:
a.
Guarantee funds payable to the county equal to one hundred twenty (120) percent of the total amount specified on the cost of improvements worksheet in the event of the default of the applicant;
b.
Upon default, as determined by the board, the creditor shall pay the county, immediately and without further action, such funds as are necessary to complete improvements up to the limit of funds stated in the documents;
c.
A letter of credit may not be withdrawn or reduced in amount until released by the county.
C.
Responsibility of applicant and security agency. The applicant shall be liable for completion of all improvements as specified in the permit and the standards of the county.
D.
Inspections. The county or the applicable special district may inspect the required improvements during and after construction to ensure satisfactory construction and completion in accordance with the permit and county and special district standards.
E.
Certification of completion. The
applicant
shall file a certification of completion with the
planning engineer
when the required
public improvements
have been completed or prior to any partial or full release of the performance
guarantee
. In no event shall the certification of completion be filed with the
planning engineer
less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration date of the performance
guarantee
. The certification shall be completed by the
applicant
and a
professional engineer
and shall certify that:
1.
The improvements have been inspected by the applicant's engineer of record or direct report and special district as required.
2.
All required improvements have been completed in accordance with the approved plans and are safe and adequate.
3.
Improvements are in compliance with the standards specified by the permit and this code as well as with those of affected special districts and servicing authorities and all federal and state laws and regulations.
4.
Neither the applicant nor the professional engineer knows of any defects in the improvements from any cause.
5.
Improvements are free and clear of any encumbrances or liens.
F.
Report to the board. Following the final inspection of the development, the official specified by the board and the applicable special district shall present a statement to the board or, if authorized, the county manager. The statement shall certify whether the required improvements are complete and satisfactory in compliance with the permit and this code.
G.
Action by the board. Upon receiving the report and any other evidence from the applicant, agencies and citizens, the board or, if authorized, the county manager, shall take one (1) or more of the following actions:
1.
Release the performance guarantee. Upon finding that the applicant has completed the improvements as specified in the permit and this code, the board shall approve the release of the performance guarantee.
2.
Reduce the performance guarantee. Upon finding that the applicant has completed a portion of the required improvements, the board may release a portion of the performance guarantee as follows:
a.
No release shall be for an amount less than twenty-five (25) percent of the total amount of the performance guarantee. In no event shall the release reduce the performance guarantee to an amount below that required to guarantee one hundred twenty (120) percent of the costs to complete all remaining work and any other obligation imposed by the DIA or to an amount less than ten (10) percent of the initial performance guarantee.
b.
The performance guarantee covering central water and sewer systems shall not be released until a professional engineer, employed by the applicant, provides a certification stating that the systems have been inspected, that they have been installed as authorized and that the systems are safe and adequate.
3.
Extend the specified completion date. Upon finding a need to extend the specified completion date because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the applicant's control, the board may extend the specified completion date for up to one (1) year beyond the original date provided the letter of credit is similarly extended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such extension shall not be deemed an extension of the vesting period for a site specific development plan unless specifically requested by the applicant and the board also agrees, in writing, to an extension of the vesting period.
4.
Applicant in default. Upon finding that an applicant has not completed the required development by the specified completion date, or that the improvements are not adequate, the board shall declare the applicant in default. Such declaration shall be in the form of a motion at a meeting of which the applicant has been notified at least ten (10) days prior to such meeting. After finding an applicant in default, the board shall take one (1) or more of the following actions:
a.
Call the performance guarantee. The board may draw on the letter of credit. These funds shall be used to complete the improvements. The work may be completed using county resources or may be contracted out to a private firm.
b.
Initiate plat/permit revocation procedure. The board may initiate the procedure to revoke the plat or permit approval.
c.
Assign proceeds. The board may assign proceeds, if any, collected under an improvement guarantee to any subsequent developer who has acquired the development by purchase, foreclosure or otherwise and who covenants to complete improvements in the subdivision or development. The agreement to assign proceeds, if any, shall only be made after approval of the subsequent developer's plan has been reviewed and approved by the board and after adequate performance guarantee has been provided by the subsequent developer in accordance with the standards of this section. The subsequent developer's obligation to complete improvements pursuant to an agreement under this section shall not be affected by the failure of the county to collect proceeds under the improvement guarantee if the county makes a good faith effort to obtain such proceeds.
d.
Pursue applicant. The board may sue the applicant for specific performance or recovery of any amount necessary to cure the default over and above the amount available under the letter of credit.
e.
Foreclosure. The board may foreclose upon and sell any lot or lots within the permit or subdivision as deemed necessary to recover the amount necessary to pay for completion of the improvements and the county's costs related to the same.
f.
Pursue any other remedy available by law.

Sec. 66-31 Fair share reimbursement for improvements
I.
Purpose.
The purpose of fair share reimbursement is to assist developers who are required by the county to install or construct public improvements as a condition of the land use permit by allowing the developer to recover some of their costs from subsequent developers whose property is likely to make use of such improvements. This section establishes the standards and procedures to receive fair share reimbursement pursuant to the authority specifically conferred by C.R.S. § 30-28-133(12) and more generally by C.R.S. §§ 30-28-101
et seq.
and C.R.S. §§ 29-20-101
et seq.
II.
Applicability.
An applicant for one (1) of the following land use permits may simultaneously seek approval of fair share reimbursement for any public improvement required by the county that is estimated to cost more than three hundred thousand (300,000) dollars:
A.
Major subdivisions under section 67-3;
B.
Manufactured home subdivisions under section 73-15;
C.
Planned unit developments under chapter 68 which include a major subdivision under section 67-3;
D.
The creation of condominiums, townhome dwellings and other forms of airspace ownership or air-right subdivisions as described and defined in C.R.S. § 38-33-101
et seq.
III.
Procedure and approval criteria for applying for fair share reimbursement.
A.
Timing of submittals.
1.
If a public improvement is identified as a potential requirement during the pre-application process, an applicant who wants to pursue fair share reimbursement must include the submittals required by this section for the application to be deemed complete and ready for agency referral pursuant to subsection 66-11.II.
2.
If a public improvement is identified as a requirement as a result of the agency referral or staff compliance review processes identified in subsection 66-11.II., an applicant who wants to pursue fair share reimbursement must provide the submittals required by this section before proceeding with the next step in the application process.
B.
Submittals. An applicant requesting fair share reimbursement for the costs of any improvement shall submit to the director a proposed cost recovery statement for each improvement. This section contemplates the possibility that there may be multiple cost recovery statements per land use permit, but under no circumstances shall an applicant be entitled to submit more than one (1) proposed cost recovery statement for a single improvement. The applicant shall submit the following items as part of the proposed cost recovery statement:
1.
A clear description and drawing of the improvement;
2.
An itemized statement, with supporting documentation for each item, of the estimated costs of the improvement. For purposes of a subsequent performance guarantee required by the county, the estimated costs of an improvement shall be the amount determined by the director necessary to guarantee funds for the completion of the improvement at the time of the recording of the final plat for the original developer's subdivision or the issuance of a land use permit, with any percentage of overage (i.e., contingency) required by the county added after such adjustment to the estimated costs;
3.
A statement, report, or study, including any data in support thereof, prepared or certified by a professional engineer, that expresses the maximum capacity of the improvement, the estimated usage of the improvement incurred by the proposed development at its maximum capacity, the net remaining capacity of the improvement after subtracting the maximum usage expected by the proposed development and the expected lifespan of the improvement, all in quantitative terms generally accepted by professionals in the relevant area of expertise and in conformance with any procedures maintained by the county. Such statement, report or study shall also include a calculation that relates the quantitative measurements of capacity to a dollar cost per unit. For example, in the case of a street, the amount should generally be expressed in terms of dollar cost per average daily trip or similar terms;
4.
A list and map of all properties, identified by parcel number, that the applicant proposes should be subject to fair share reimbursement as potentially benefitted properties, together with a scaled drawing establishing the location of the relevant improvement in relation to these properties. For all such potentially benefitted properties, an applicant shall provide a list of the names and mailing addresses of the owners based on the most current records of the county assessor's office;
5.
An explanation describing how each potentially benefitted property is either adjacent to the improvement or will have presumed use of the improvement such that any fair share reimbursement that may be required for the development of such property shall comply with the requirements of C.R.S. §§ 29-20-203, 30-28-133(12) and the United States and Colorado Constitutions;
6.
A statement proposing the duration of the reimbursement period, as well as supporting rational for the proposed duration based on the expected life and capacity of the improvement throughout the proposed reimbursement period. The proposed duration shall not exceed fifteen (15) years from the date of completion of an improvement.
C.
Director’s review. The director shall review the proposed cost recovery statement to make a preliminary determination that it is complete to accept for review. The director has the authority and the discretion to require an applicant to provide updates, revisions, clarifications, or supplementary materials that the director determines are necessary for the initial review. At any time during this review, the applicant may amend the proposed cost recovery statement either of its own volition or pursuant to any request from the director. Subject to the timing of submittals in paragraph 66-31.III.A. above, an application shall not proceed to the next step of the review and public meeting process until the director determines the submittals required by this section are compliant. Thereafter, any staff report to the planning commission or board shall include a recommendation of approval, approval with conditions, or denial of fair share reimbursement.
D.
Notice to potentially benefitted property owners.
1.
If the director determines that a neighborhood meeting is appropriate, the notice required by section 66-11.IV. for neighborhood meetings shall, in addition to any recipients required by section 66-14, include the owners of all potentially benefitted property. In addition to any other information required in the notice by section 66-14, it shall include a narrative of the improvement, estimated cost, and statement that a copy of the proposed cost recovery statement may be obtained from the director. Such notice shall also inform the potentially benefitted property owner that they have the right to send written comments on the proposed cost recovery statement to the director and may comment at any public meeting on the approval of the cost recovery statement. Thereafter, any notices required by this code to be sent to surrounding owners shall include the owners of all potentially benefitted property as well as then-current versions of all materials required by this subparagraph 66-31.III.D.1.
2.
If no neighborhood meeting is held, or if the timing of the fair share reimbursement submittals is after the neighborhood meeting, all notices required by this code to be sent to surrounding owners shall include the owners of potentially benefitted property as well as the then-current versions of all materials required by subparagraph 66-31.III.D.1. above.
3.
Fair share reimbursement shall not be approved without at least one (1) public meeting pursuant to subsection 66-12.II. and without public notice pursuant to section 66-14. All descriptions of the project in public notices shall include the applicant’s intent to request fair share reimbursement pursuant to this section.
E.
Payment of administrative fee for processing of cost recovery statement. Prior to any meeting that is scheduled for the consideration of final approval of a land use permit for which fair share reimbursement is being requested, the applicant shall submit to the county an administrative processing fee equal to the actual costs incurred by the county in staff time and consulting fees in evaluating the proposed cost recovery statement. This fee shall be charged to reimburse the county for the costs of administering and processing the proposed cost recovery statement and shall be nonrefundable, regardless of fair share reimbursement approval. The county may also charge a fee to reimburse the county for the costs of administering a development application for a secondary developer subject to a fair share reimbursement.
F.
Recording of notice of fair share reimbursement. As soon as practicable after the issuance of a land use permit that includes an approved fair share reimbursement, the original developer shall prepare and submit to the county clerk and recorder for recording a notice of fair share reimbursement in the chain of title for each approved benefitted property in a form approved by the county attorney. Recording of the notice of fair share reimbursement is merely a statement that a unique government land use regulation may apply to a property. The notice is not a lien or any other type of encumbrance on the chain of title for said property. Such notice shall include the original developer's mailing address and specify the approved reimbursement period and that the fair share reimbursement may be amended. The notice shall also specify that it shall automatically expire at such time without filing of a release. The approved version of the cost recovery statement shall be attached to the recorded notice. Because the initial right to fair share reimbursement is approved prior to completion of the improvement, the original developer or its successor in interest must record an amended notice, with an amended cost recovery statement approved pursuant to paragraph 66-31.III.G. below, in the property records after completion of the improvement. The amended notice shall identify the final cost, the date the improvement was completed and the ending date of the reimbursement period and shall attach the approved amended cost recovery statement. The right to receive fair share reimbursement runs with the land that was subject to the land use permit that included an approved right to fair share reimbursement.
G.
After completion of the improvement, an original developer must amend the cost recovery statement to include the final and actual costs of the improvement. The amended cost recovery statement shall be submitted to the director and may be approved administratively by the director. As-built drawings and documentation shall be provided for each item to support the actual costs and completed improvement. If the director believes that the amended cost recovery statement is significantly different from the original, the director may place such amended cost recovery statement on the board’s agenda for consideration.
IV.
Approval criteria
. Fair share reimbursement shall only be approved as part of a land use permit if the decision-making body determines that all approval criteria are satisfied. In reviewing a proposed cost recovery statement, a review body and a decision-making body shall consider the following approval criteria:
A.
The estimated costs are reasonable in light of the nature of the improvement and prevailing market rates;
B.
The improvement confers a public benefit;
C.
All proposed potentially benefitted properties are either adjacent to or will have presumed use of the improvement if the potentially benefitted property is developed in the future;
D.
The reimbursement period is reasonable in light of the nature of the improvement, the amount of excess capacity available for use by potentially benefitted properties, and the expected life-span of the improvement.
V.
Procedure for payment of fair share reimbursement.
A.
Rebuttable presumption. The recording of a notice of fair share reimbursement pursuant to this section following issuance of a land use permit that includes the right to fair share reimbursement creates a rebuttable presumption that the owner of the benefitted property owes a fair share of the costs of the subject improvement to the owner of record of the property that was subject to the land use permit that included the right to fair share reimbursement, if:
1.
The owner of the benefitted property submits an application for a land use permit (or conducts any development for which a land use permit was required, even if no permit was pursued) related to such benefitted property;
2.
The reimbursement period had not expired at the time of the activity identified in 1 above.
B.
Payment of fair share reimbursement.
1.
If a secondary developer submits an application for a land use permit related to benefitted property, such application shall not be a complete application until the secondary developer submits a statement, report or study, including any data in support thereof, prepared or certified by a professional engineer, that expresses the estimated usage of the improvement incurred by the proposed development at its maximum capacity, all in quantitative terms generally accepted by professionals in the relevant area of expertise and consistent with the units of measurement used in the approved cost recovery statement and any procedures maintained by the county.
2.
The owner of record of the original developer’s property that was subject to the land use permit that included the right to fair share reimbursement shall receive written notice of the secondary development.
a.
If the director determines that a neighborhood meeting is appropriate, the notice required by subsection 66-11.IV. for neighborhood meetings shall, in addition to any recipients required by section 66-14, include the owner of record of the original developer’s property. In addition to any other information required in the notice by section 66-14, it shall include a narrative of the proposed development and a copy of the cost recovery statement, report or study that identifies its proposed use and fair share reimbursement. Such notice shall also inform the owner of record of the original developer’s property that they have the right to send written comments on the proposed fair share reimbursement to the director and may comment at any public meeting on the approval of the proposed development. Thereafter, any notices required by this code to be sent to surrounding owners shall include the owner of record of the original developer’s property.
b.
If no neighborhood meeting is held, or if the timing of the fair share reimbursement submittals is after the neighborhood meeting, all notices required by this code to be sent to surrounding owners shall include the owner of record of the original developer’s property and shall include the then-current versions of the materials required by sub-subparagraph 66-31.IV.B.2.a. above.
3.
Payment of obligation required before recording of final plat or issuance of land use permit. If the decision-making body approves or conditionally approves the secondary developer’s development, the secondary developer shall not record a final plat or receive a land use permit until the secondary developer:
a.
Tenders, or attempts in good faith to tender, good funds in full to the owner of record of the original developer’s property in the amount established by the decision-making body;
b.
Provides adequate proof to the director in a form acceptable to the county that such funds have either been paid or that a good faith effort has been made by the secondary developer to deliver the funds. For the purposes of attempting to tender such funds, the secondary developer shall be determined to have acted in good faith if they have attempted to contact the owner of record of the original developer’s property at the last address listed in the assessor’s records for the original developer’s property as well as the address listed on the most recent notice of fair share reimbursement recorded in the chain of title of the subject property.
c.
Alternative payment. Nothing in this section may be construed to prohibit an original developer and a secondary developer from entering into a private agreement for the recovery by the original developer of all or part of the costs for any particular improvement. However, any such agreement renders an original developer ineligible to seek fair share reimbursement from such secondary developer for the benefitted property pursuant to this section for the relevant improvement. If a private agreement is made with respect to alternative payment of fair share reimbursement, as soon as practicable thereafter the owner of record of the original developer’s property shall record a notice of release of fair share reimbursement indicating that the property is no longer subject to any recovery of fair share reimbursement under this section and provide a copy of the same to the director.

Sec. 66-32 Review of historic resources
I.
Purpose
. The purpose of this section is to establish a process that identifies historic resources prior to their demolition, moving, or major alteration. The goal is to provide documentation of historic resources in the county and to encourage applicants to consider the benefits of historic preservation. There is no obligation for an applicant to alter their development proposal based upon this section, rather the process serves as a source of information should a landowner decide to preserve a historic resource on their property.
II.
Applicability.
The review process pertains to historic resources which are structures or landscape features over fifty (50) years of age and possess architectural integrity or cultural significance. This includes buildings that were erected to shelter human activity such as houses, barns, schools, churches, and other structures which include bridges, and historic landscape features such as orchards, ditches and roads. This applies to historic resources listed on the La Plata County Register of Historic Places, the survey of one hundred (100) historic resources completed in 2010, and any other structure or landscape feature that meet the definition of a historic resource. This section does not address prehistoric archaeological sites, since these sites are reviewed under the Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979.
III.
Review process.
If the CDD determines a potential historic resource is located on the development site, the following steps may apply:
A.
The applicant shall identify the historic resource in the project narrative and relevant submittal materials. Such materials shall be referred to the County’s Historic Preservation Review Commission during the agency referral period pursuant to subsection 66-11.II.
B.
A member of the HPRC may contact the applicant to schedule a site visit to gather information on the historic resource. The HPRC member may meet on-site to discuss the history and document any available historical information.
C.
Using available property maps, the HPRC member may develop a rendering, floor plan or site plan of the historic resource indicating dimensions/measurements, and building location within the site. The HPRC member may take site photos and photos of the affected structures including all elevations and notable features. The photos shall be recorded on a photo log listing the date, subject, photo orientation, and photo number.
D.
The HPRC member may assemble the property materials into a brief report for county staff within one (1) week following the agency referral period. The HPRC member shall email the report to the CDD and be available for any additional discussion or clarification as necessary.

A.
Description of the acceptable and prohibited uses on the property;
B.
The density of proposed uses, including maximum floor area and height of buildings;
C.
Provisions for the preservation or dedication of land for public purposes;
D.
Proposed schedule for the construction of public improvements and assurances that public improvements will be available as needed to serve new development;
E.
Proposed timing and phasing of the project;
F.
Provisions to mitigate the impacts of the development on the general public, including the protection of the environmentally sensitive lands;
G.
Provisions for public benefits or improvements in excess of what is required by county policy or law;
H.
Terms relating to applicant financing of facilities and subsequent reimbursement;
I.
Terms for subsequent discretionary actions, provided such terms shall not prevent the development of the property for the uses set forth in the agreement;
J.
A provision that construction shall begin by a specified date or that certain phases shall be completed within a specified time;
K.
Termination date for the development agreement.
III.
Notice requirements and public meeting.
A.
After a proposed development agreement has been negotiated by staff and the applicant, the review body, if applicable, and decision-making body shall each conduct a public meeting at which it shall review and take action on the proposed development agreement.
B.
The process shall include posting the subject property with a notice of public meeting, publishing a notice of the public meeting and providing mail notification to adjacent property owners as prescribed by section 66-14.
C.
Upon approval of the development agreement, a notice of such approval and creation of the vested right shall be made by publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the county no later than fourteen (14) days following approval.
IV.
Approval criteria
. The county shall consider and act upon a request for a development agreement in its sole discretion and the terms of the development agreement may involve negotiation between the county and the developer. The board shall be the decision-making body for all development agreements and the director may, depending upon the nature of the development agreement, also seek review of the development agreement by the applicable review body. If a subdivision or planned unit development is associated with the proposed development agreement, the development agreement shall be reviewed by the review body and decision-making body at the same time as the subdivision or planned unit development. In reviewing and acting upon proposed development agreements, the decision-making body and review body, if applicable, shall consider the review and approval criteria for the development application and the following additional criteria:
A.
Whether the plan or project is sufficiently well-defined to justify vesting for the period proposed;
B.
Whether there are sufficient corresponding benefits to the county and its citizens to justify granting any or all of the vested property rights requested for the development;
C.
Whether any forecasts of future off-site land uses, infrastructure, traffic and drainage conditions are reliable throughout the vesting period, as those studies are required to be updated from time to time;
D.
Whether the development agreement is required to mitigate impacts that would otherwise make the proposed development unacceptable.

Sec. 66-37 Animas Valley rezoning
I.
Applicability
. Applications for development which are not in conformance with the AVLUP shall not be accepted by staff. To be submitted, the plan must first be amended to allow for the intended use or density. The process for rezoning applications shall require a public meeting before the planning commission or joint planning commission, and a subsequent meeting before the board. This section applies to such rezoning applications.
II.
Procedures.
Figure 66-37 below identifies the application steps that apply to the review of an Animas Valley rezoning.
Figure 66-37: Summary of Animas Valley Rezoning Procedures
III.
Approval criteria.
An amendment to the AVLUP is a matter subject to the board’s legislative discretion. Accordingly, the general approval criteria stated in section 66-16 shall not apply to the review of a proposed rezoning application. Instead, the board shall consider the following specific approval criteria for an Animas Valley rezoning:
A.
The amendment is justified by one (1) of the following factors:
1.
The land subject to the rezoning was previously zoned in error.
2.
Events subsequent to the adoption of the original plan have invalidated the original intent.
3.
The character or conditions of the area have changed so that the rezoning is in general conformance with the comprehensive plan and Animas Valley district plan.
B.
The amendment satisfies all of the following criteria:
1.
The change is in general conformance with the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan and Animas Valley district plan.
2.
The purpose of the proposed zoning district as stated in chapter 65, compared to the existing zoning district, will better implement applicable comprehensive plan or Animas Valley district plan goals, objectives or policies.
3.
Adequate infrastructure is available to serve new development in the proposed zoning district; or the proposed zoning district would limit demands upon infrastructure more than the existing zone; or reasonable assurances are provided that adequate infrastructure will be made available to serve new development by the time the new development places demands on the facilities.
4.
The types of land uses and density permitted within the proposed zoning district are more suitable to the property when compared to the existing zoning district with respect to identified potential natural hazards such as steep or unstable slopes, avalanche areas, debris fans, and floodplain areas and considering reasonable assurances for mitigation of any such hazards.
5.
The proposed rezoning will not adversely affect the existing or planned land uses on adjacent properties or the surrounding area.
6.
The change will not conflict with any intergovernmental agreement then in effect between the county and any other unit of government.
C.
The change advances the general public health, safety and welfare.

Sec. 66-38 Economic development area designations
I.
Applicability.
This section establishes a process by which the county may designate particular geographical areas as being subject to specialized land use regulations for commercial, industrial, or mixed residential/commercial development. Designation of a particular economic development area as being subject to specialized land use regulations may be initiated by the board, the PC, the director, or by any person or collection of persons who own real property within the area to be designated.
II.
Procedures.
Figure 66-38 below identifies the steps that apply to the designation of economic development area. In the AVLUP, an EDA shall be designated using the process for rezoning set forth in section 66-37 followed by recording a designated EDA as set forth in this subsection 66-38.II.
Figure 66-28: Summary of Economic Development Area Designation Procedures
III.
Approval criteria.
The PC and board shall consider the following, at a minimum, when designating a particular economic development area as subject to specialized land use regulations, and in their respective actions, shall enter findings relative to each of the following elements:
A.
Existing or potential for infrastructure. The intensity and type of current and foreseeable development in the area, including an analysis and evaluation of the availability of water, wastewater treatment, and capacity of the roadway to adequately serve the development area within five (5) years as demonstrated by either the servicing entity or existing services.
B.
Rationale and need for designation. The purpose and need of the proposed designation, with a demonstrated need for the designation, in the location proposed, to serve the area’s existing and projected development.

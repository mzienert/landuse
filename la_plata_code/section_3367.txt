ARTICLE V METHODS OF COMPETITIVE SOURCE SELECTION FOR STANDARD PURCHASES
This article describes the appropriate methods of competitive source selection for
standard purchases
(i.e., purchases with a contract requirement of more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). Generally, while
IFBs
or
RFPs
will be used, the
contract manager
in consultation with the finance director, may also determine that an
RFI
,
RFQ
or other tools should also be utilized. When such tools are used, the procurement division will outline the process to be used, in writing, prior to letting a
solicitation
. The provisions of this article do not apply to the source selection methods applicable to
small purchases
or
simplified purchases
.
Sec. 20-55   Other methods of competitive source selection
The
contract manager
may recommend and utilize, upon approval of the finance director, any other form of competitive source
solicitation
, such as by way of example only, a
competitive reverse auction
, a
request for information
or a
request for qualifications,
when such an alternative may be better suited to meet a specific need or ensure the best value to the county. If an alternative solicitation method is followed, a written explanation of the reasons and the process followed shall be included in the
contract
file.

Sec. 6-4 Investigation of application
I.
Designated neighborhood
. The local licensing authority shall review the number and type of existing liquor licenses located within the designated neighborhood for which the applicant has applied. In most cases, the designated neighborhood should encompass an area within approximately one-half (1/2) mile of the premises under consideration. Upon request of the applicant or upon its own initiative, and upon a showing of good cause, the local licensing authority may, at its discretion, enlarge or reduce the area encompassed in the designated neighborhood. In considering the neighborhood to be designated the local authority may consider terrain, natural boundaries and artificial barriers defining the neighborhood. The neighborhood designation shall be approved by the local licensing authority prior to the applicant petitioning inhabitants of the designated neighborhood.
II.
Petitions
. Needs and desires of a neighborhood may be established through live testimony at the license hearing and through petitions. When required, petitions shall be circulated by the applicant or its agent on forms furnished by the licensing coordinator. Completed petitions shall be submitted no later than seven (7) days before the public hearing to the licensing coordinator. Completed petitions submitted to establish the desires of the neighborhood shall only contain signatures of residents and/or owners or managers of businesses twenty-one (21) years of age or older within the designated neighborhood and the printed name of each signatory shall be legible. Completed petitions shall contain the signature, address and age of each signatory and an indication of approval or denial of the application.

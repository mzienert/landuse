Article III. Building Codes and standards: Amendments, additions and deletions to the international codes
Sec. 18-36
Amendments and Deletions to the 2015 International Residential Code.
Amendments and Deletions to the 2015 International Residential Code are as follows:
(
Res. No. 2004-15, § 1 (Exh. A), 05/24/2004; Res. No. 2017-33, § 18-36, 10/10/2017; Res. No. 2023-15, § 18-36, 06/06/2023
)
Section R401 (Foundations)
General
R401.1 Application. Exception 3 below is added to Section R401.1 of the 2015 International
Residential
Code
:
3.  Where soil conditions allow, the
use
of the foundation designs set forth in Attachment 1 to this Code will be allowed.  The
standards
set forth in Attachment 1 are not designed for use in expansive soils or soils with low bearing capacity such as unconsolidated
sand
or silt. Determination of the location of expansive soils will be based on mapping in the La Plata
County
GIS maps and the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture- Soil Survey of La Plata County (see Section R401.4). When snow loads at the
building
site
exceed 80 psf, live load engineered foundation
plans
may be required by the
building official
.
R401.3
Drainage
.  Section R401.3 of the 2015 International Residential Code is deleted and replaced with the following:
All foundation systems shall be provided with compacted backfill graded in a manner that assures
surface water
will be directed away from the foundation system.  The grade shall fall a minimum of 6 inches within the first 10 feet.  No water shall adversely
impact
adjacent
lots
or
structures
.
Exception: Where lot lines, walls,
slopes
or other physical barriers prohibit 6 inches (152 mm) of fall within 10 feet (3048 mm), drains or swales shall be constructed to ensure drainage away from the structure. Impervious
surfaces
within 10 feet (3048 mm) of the building foundation shall be sloped to a minimum of 2 percent away from the building.
R401.4 Soil tests.  Section R401.4 of the 2015 International Residential Code is deleted and replaced with the following:
Classification of soils will be based on soil reports, visual observations, “The Soil Survey of La Plata County Area of Colorado” provided by the U.S. Dept. of
Agriculture
Soil
Construction
1981-82, and maps of the La Plata County GIS. When it is determined that expansive soils exist at a
project
location for a residential structure, soil tests and engineered foundation systems will be required for all residential structures.  Pursuant to section
18-35
(107.2), the building official shall determine the need for special engineering of the foundation system to address the
adverse
soil conditions when questionable soil characteristics are likely present.

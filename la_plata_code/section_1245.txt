Administration, ch. 2.
Sec. 78-53. Application approval or denial.
Approval or denial of a
floodplain development permit
by the
floodplain administrator
shall
be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors:
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
The susceptibility of the proposed
facility
and its contents to
flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner
;
The danger that materials
may
be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The compatibility of the proposed
use
with existing and anticipated
development
;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency
vehicles
;
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave
action
, if applicable, expected at the
site
;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
The relationship of the proposed use to any comprehensive plan, master plan or
floodplain management
program for that area, if applicable.
For waterways with
base flood elevations
for which a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no
new construction
,
substantial improvements
, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the
county
FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and reasonably anticipated development, will not increase the
water surface elevation
of the
base flood
more than one-half foot at any point within the county.
Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, as amended, the floodplain administrator may approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the county's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one-half foot, provided that the
applicant
first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through
FEMA
(conditional letter of map revision), fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of 44 CFR § 65.12 and receives FEMA approval.

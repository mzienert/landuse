b.
Amend to delete Section 3.0 - Design Distribution for CUHP in its entirety.
6.
Chapter 7 – Streets, Inlets, and Storm Drains. Amend to add the following:
a.
Design Depth Criteria. The primary design objective is to keep the encroachment of stormwater on the street or road below an acceptable limit for a given flood return period. When stormwater collects on a street and flows down a gutter or swale, the stormwater encroaches into the roadway. If left unchecked, the encroachment will hinder traffic flow and may become hazardous. The maximum encroachment depth over the crown is six (6) inches during the ten (10) year storm and eighteen (18) inches during the one hundred (100) year storm. The public works director shall determine county roads and arterial roadways overtopping.
7.
Chapter 8 – Open Channels. Amend to add the following:
a.
Freeboard is one (1) foot. Grass-lined open channels conveying less than fifty (50) cubic feet per second (cfs) may reduce the minimum freeboard to convey one and thirty-three hundredths (1.33) times the one hundred (100) year storm event design flow.
b.
Grass-lined channels shall be designed so that flow velocities do not exceed six (6) feet per second during the one hundred (100) year storm. If velocities above six (6) feet per second are unavoidable, provide channel stabilization that meets industry standards and provide calculations showing shear forces generated during the one hundred (100) year storm.
c.
Side slopes shall not exceed two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical (2H:1V). If slopes are greater than 2H:1V are unavoidable due to site constraints, provide documentation showing how channels will be safely stabilized and maintained.

Chapter 12 – Storage. Amend to add the following:
a.
2.0 - Implementation of Regional, Sub-regional, and On-site Detention.
i.
Exemptions to stormwater detention. Exemptions to stormwater detention shall not jeopardize the public health, safety, and welfare of public and private property. The applicant shall provide documentation at submittal to demonstrate that project qualifies for an exemption. The following uses are exempt from stormwater detention:
i.
Development of sites where the use does not increase the one hundred (100) year runoff by five (5) percent or total increase is less than one (1) cubic feet per second, whichever is less.
ii.
An individual parcel with an unobstructed flow path and no other parcel between the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) regulatory floodplain channel and the project. Water quality measures may still be required.
iii.
Residential lots where all of the following exist: Nine (9) or fewer lots, average lot size greater than or equal to two (2) acres per lot.
ii.
The county requires detention of runoff through an on-site or regional detention facility. The required volume detains the difference between the one hundred (100) year storm falling on the developed site and the one hundred (100) year storm falling on the undeveloped site.
iii.
The detention facility outlet structure shall release the detained water in two (2) stages:
i.
Ten (10) year storm event pre-development flow during the ten (10) year storm event post-development flow;
ii.
One hundred (100) year storm event pre-development flow during the one hundred (100) year storm event post-development flow.
iv.
Detention volumes shall be calculated by the difference in pre-development and post-development hydrographs or by the modified rational method.
v.
The design of the detention facility must provide evidence that the pond will drain in accordance with C.R.S. § 37-92-602(8), as amended. A detention facility that can cause injury to water rights or is in violation of state or federal law will not be accepted.
vi.
Amend to delete subsection 2.4 - Detention and UDFCD 100-year Floodplain Management Policy in its entirety. The county’s floodplain management policy can be found in Chapter 78: Floodplain Management of the La Plata Land Use Code.
b.
3.0 - Full Spectrum Detention. Amend to delete this section in its entirety.
c.
4.0 - Sizing of Full Spectrum Detention Storage Volumes. Amend to delete this section in its entirety.
d.
5.0 - Design Considerations. Amend to add the following:
i.
Each detention facility shall include volume for the water quality capture volume. Water quality capture volume may be included as a portion of the total one hundred (100) year storm event detention facilities’ volume. The water quality capture volume is to be drained over forty (40) hours.
ii.
Side slopes. Side slopes of the embankment shall not be steeper than three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical except where retaining walls are used.
iii.
The elevation of the top of the embankment should be a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year water surface elevation.
iv.
Each detention facility shall contain an emergency spillway capable of conveying the un-detained one hundred (100) year storm discharge draining into the detention facility, both on-site and off-site. The inside crest elevation of the emergency spillway shall be equal to, or above, the one hundred (100) year water surface elevation. The depth of flow out of the emergency spillway shall be six (6) inches or less. The spillway shall have effective erosion protection. In order to protect the emergency spillway from catastrophic erosion failure, buried or grouted riprap shall be placed from the emergency spillway downhill to the embankment toe of slope and covered with six (6) inches of topsoil, if buried. Grouting of the riprap may be required.
v.
The outlet pipe bedding material must consist of native earthen soil, not granular bedding material, to at least the first downstream manhole or daylight point.
vi.
Irrigation ditches shall not be used as outfall points for stormwater runoff without written permission from the controlling entity. If allowed, the outlet invert shall be above the normal operational water surface elevation to prevent irrigation water from entering the detention facility.
e.
6.0 - Additional Configurations of Detention Facilities. Amend to add the following:
i.
Retention facilities are only allowed where a detention facility is not practical and where there are no adverse impacts to upstream or downstream properties.
ii.
Retention facilities shall be designed to contain two (2) times the additional volume of the runoff due to the development generated by the twenty-four (24) hour, one hundred (100) year storm, plus one (1) foot of freeboard.
iii.
The design of the retention facility must include an emergency spillway and must show that a spill will not adversely impact downstream properties or residences. The spillway must be designed in accordance with the detention facility spillway requirements.
iv.
The design of the retention facility must provide evidence that the pond will drain through the bottom (sides slopes cannot be used in calculation) in accordance with C.R.S. § 37-92-602(8), as amended. Percolation rates for the on-site soil shall be provided. A retention pond that can cause injury to water rights or is in violation of state or federal law will not be accepted.

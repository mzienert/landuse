Sec. 58-68. Assessment of costs—Hearing.
The
landowner
or occupant, or an attorney on his or her behalf, will be allowed to present testimony to the
advisory commission
as to why they should not assess a tax lien on landowner or occupant's property for the costs outlined in the payment notice/potential lien assessment letter.
A member of the
weed office
will need to be present at the hearing to provide evidence favoring the imposition of a tax lien on landowner or occupant's property.
The weed office must show that prior to compelling the
management
of
noxious weeds
on landowner and/or occupant's property the weed office applied the same or greater management measures to any land or rights-of-way owned or administered by the
BOCC
that are adjacent to the private property pursuant to section
58-63.
The weed office must show that the level of management called for in the notice or the
management plan
developed by the arbitration panel has been successfully achieved pursuant to section
58-69.
The advisory commission
may
either grant or deny the lien assessment or continue the matter to a subsequent date certain.
If the advisory commission grants the lien assessment, the resolution for certification of assessed costs as granted by the BOCC is filed with the
county
treasurer's office.

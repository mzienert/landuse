Chemical management, which means the use of herbicides or plant growth regulators to disrupt the growth of noxious weeds.

Containment, which means maintaining an intensively managed buffer zone that separates infested regions, where suppression activities prevail, from largely uninfested regions, where eradication activities prevail.

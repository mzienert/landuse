Sec. 20-1 Purpose and authority
I.
Purpose
. Stewardship of public funds is a fundamental responsibility of county government. The public must have confidence that public funds are spent prudently and transparently on its behalf, with proper planning and evaluation, in a manner that is open and fair to all.
Under the direction of the Board of County Commissioners (“BOCC”), the La Plata County Procurement Code (this “code”) sets forth the policies and procedures that adhere to applicable laws and a commitment to promote competition, maximize purchasing power, and ensure fair opportunity and equitable treatment of all who seek to do business with the county.
The purpose of this
code
is to guide county personnel in fulfilling their obligations to the public, grantors,
vendors
, and
contractors
in the expenditure of public funds. The code is a comprehensive reference manual for both county personnel and outside parties who have an interest in the county’s
procurement
and contracting processes. It is intended as a guide to good procurement practices and is to be used as a supplement to state law, sound business judgment in procurement and contracting.
The policies set forth in this code are intended to:
1.    Provide a procurement program encompassing nationally and regionally approved principles and practices.
2.    Be reviewed, thoughtfully and regularly, to ensure the utility of the code and to make periodic modifications          and improvements that will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the procurement function.
3.   Promote and encourage ethical management and efficiency in the county procurement procedures.
4.   Support consistent procurement procedures within all county departments.
5.   Bolster public confidence in public procurement procedures.
6.    Ensure the fair and equitable treatment of all persons dealing with the county procurement system.
7.    Provide increased economy in county procurement activities.
8.    Maximize the procurement value of county funds.
9.    Safeguard the high quality and integrity of the procurement system.
10.  Ensure that the expenditure of public funds complies with the terms and conditions of the funding source.
This code is presented in a manner that is intended to address each of these factors in a straightforward and       practical way.
Article 1 explains why, when and how to use this code.
Article 2 explains the roles and responsibilities of those involved in public procurement.
Article 3 explains how to select vendors and conduct county purchases.
Article 4 explains the key to every successful purchase: specifications and scopes of work.
Article 5 explains the competitive solicitation processes and the requirements of each.
Article 6 explains the contract options that apply to every purchase, regardless of amount.
Article 7 explains the determination, protest, claims and dispute resolution processes.
Article 8 explains the legal and ethical obligations of every public employee.
II. Authority.
This code is adopted pursuant to the power and authorities conferred by the laws of the State of Colorado, including but not limited to the following sections of the Colorado Revised Statutes: Article 11 of Title 30 (County Powers and Functions); Article 20 of Title 30 (Public Improvements); and Article 25 of Title 30 (Administration of County Finance).

In addition, while
elected officials
may adopt their own
procurement
procedures, to ensure compliance with federal procurement rules and regulations that are applicable to various federal grants and/or
contracts
, as well as support fair and consistent procurement procedures, elected officials and their offices are encouraged to adopt and abide by this code. Procurement assistance from county staff can only be provided to elected officials operating under this code.

d. Transcripts or other records required by the county attorney or district attorney.
15. Any other purchase the BOCC formally determines to be exempt due to reasons not anticipated by this code.
Nothing in this code shall prevent the county from complying with the terms and conditions of any grant, gift, bequest, contract, or cooperative agreement that is otherwise consistent with the law. If any provision of this code causes denial of state or federal monies that would otherwise be available to the county or is inconsistent with requirements of state or federal law, that provision shall be suspended to the extent necessary to prevent denial of the monies or to eliminate the inconsistency with state or federal law. Specifically, when procurement involves the expenditure of federal assistance or contract funds, procurement shall be conducted in accordance with any mandatory, applicable federal law and regulations.

Sec. 20-4 Introduction to public procurement
Procurement
in the public sector is the process through which a government acquires
goods
and
services
. The terms “procurement” and “purchasing” are often used interchangeably. However, strictly speaking, “purchasing” is only one of three stages of the public procurement cycle.
The three (3) stages of public procurement are:
I.
Planning and scheduling.
This stage includes defining the need, developing the means and methods to meet the need, including the method of source selection, assessing risks, and ensuring proper allocation of resources.
II.
Purchasing and source selection.
This stage represents the process through which qualified providers of goods and services are identified,
solicited
, evaluated, and ultimately selected. The method of source selection, dictated by the amount of the expenditure, is determined in the planning and scheduling stage.
III.
Contract formation and administration.
This stage includes confirmation of expected performance measures, finalization of terms and conditions, and signature of authorized parties. This stage also includes post-
award
compliance with and enforcement of the terms of the resulting
contract
, including payment of invoices and adherence to insurance, amendment and renewal requirements through contract completion.
The appropriate procurement process to be followed in any given circumstance is dependent upon a variety of factors. A conceptual framework for determining the appropriate process is summarized as follows:
1
. Nature of purchase.
The nature of the purchase dictates: (a) whether public competition is required, and (b) whether additional approvals are required.
2.
Amount spent.
The amount to be spent dictates: (a) who has the authority to make the purchase, (b) what kind of competitive solicitation, if any, is required, and (c) who has the authority to sign the contract.
3.
Memorialization
. Every purchase and sale, regardless of type or amount, must be memorialized in a written document that identifies the rights and obligations of both the
buyer
and the seller.

Sec. 20-27 Specific comments or approvals required
Certain purchases are of such a nature that the county’s need and ability to properly use the item or
service
purchased should be evaluated by the appropriate department head prior to purchase. In such instances, regardless of the
procurement
method followed, including a
small purchase
, comments from or signature approval of the appropriate department head, as set forth below, shall be obtained prior to
solicitation
. This approval indicates that the purchase is compatible with but not duplicative of existing county resources. Additional department head purchase approval is required in the following instances:
I.
Technology purchases
including computer hardware, copy machines and software, regardless of price, must be reviewed by the director of the county’s information technology (“IT”) department, or the director’s designee, prior to solicitation or purchase, in the case of a small purchase. The IT director will review each request to determine all systems issues, including compatibility, support, architectural standards, and implementation and integration capabilities. When no systemic issues are presented, the IT director’s approval should be reflected in the
purchase requisition
or other documentation. When the IT director expresses concerns over a proposed solicitation or purchase, the county manager may either approve or deny a department’s or elected official’s proposed technology purchase.
II.
Professional services involving county facilities

ARTICLE III – THE PUBLIC PROCUREMENT PROCESS; ACQUISITION AND DISPOSAL OF GOODS AND SERVICES
This article III sets forth how
vendors
are to be identified and solicited and how personal property will be disposed of by the county.  Generally, all county purchases and
contracts
shall be procured competitively, unless otherwise set forth in this
code
.
Both applicable law and the
BOCC
recognize, however, that it is not always in the
county’s best interest
to expend the time and resources required to make a
standard purchase
. As a result, certain exceptions based upon the nature and amount of the purchase are recognized. Whenever an exception is used to identify and select a
vendor
, the appropriate contract file should reflect the exception utilized and how it applied to the specific circumstance.
Regardless of the way the vendor is selected and regardless of the amount of the purchase, a contract with that vendor is required (see article VI).

)
Effective on: 1/1/2021
Sec. 20-32 Exceptions to competitive solicitation requirements based on source of good or service or emergency
I.
Sole source purchase
. A
sole source purchase
is any purchase of a
good
or
service
with a
contract
requirement of more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) that does not meet the competitive solicitation standards of either a
simplified purchase
or a
standard purchase
. The term also includes any
contract amendment
or extension outside the terms of the original
solicitation
and contract.
A.
General rule and application
. A sole source purchase is permissible when: (1) the
contract manager
determines that there is only one source for the required goods or services; or (2) when the contract manager determines, after investigating the prevailing market for the relevant goods or services, that re-bidding a contract would result in higher costs and lower returns to the county than those enjoyed under an existing contract. In either case, the finance director must approve the
sole source justification
.
1.
Application of rule
. Sole source refers to the supplier, not the product or service. Justification for a sole source purchase depends upon a needed item or service being available from only a single supplier under the prevailing conditions.
a.
Examples of circumstances that could necessitate a sole source procurement include:
i.
The purchase of technical equipment for which there is no competitive product, and which is available only from one supplier;
ii.
The purchase of
professional services
from a vendor, who is uniquely qualified to provide such services;
iii.
The purchase of a component or replacement part for which there is no commercially available product, and which can be obtained only from the manufacturer;
iv.
The purchase of an item where compatibility is the overriding consideration;
v.
The purchase of a used item which becomes immediately available and is subject to prior sale;
vi.
The purchase of a product for a trial or testing;
vii.
The use of other than original equipment manufacturer parts would void a still valid warranty; or
viii.
The purchase of a product or service from a vendor that has been awarded a contract by another governmental entity and that allows its product or service to be purchased by other governmental agencies from that contract.
b.
Examples of circumstances that do not necessitate or warrant use of a sole source procurement include:
i.
Whenever the item or service may be obtained from more than one source;
ii.
The vendor has provided excellent service or products in the past;
iii.
The vendor is familiar with the county’s preferred practices;
iv.
No other vendor can do the job as well; or
v.
There is insufficient time to vet the credentials of any other vendor, unless an emergency exists.
B.
Budget
. Only those purchases that are authorized in an approved
budget
will be procured.
C.
Authorization
. Department heads and
elected officials
are authorized to initiate sole source purchases when the amount to be spent is within an approved budget, a written sole source justification is prepared, and the sole source justification is approved by the finance director.
D.
Scope of work or specifications
. A written
scope of work
or specifications is required to complete the mandatory sole source justification form.
E.
Solicitation standard – sole source justification
. The standard by which the fairness and cost efficiency of a sole source purchase is determined shall be set forth in a written sole source justification form, signed by the department head or elected official, that includes:
1.
A description of the scope of work or specifications sought;
2.
An explanation of why no other supplier will be suitable or acceptable to meet the need;
3.
An explanation of how cost reasonableness was determined; and
4.
The finance director’s signature.
F.
Documentation and contract
. The contract manager is responsible for maintaining documentation of any sole source purchase.
G.
Contract
award
. The appropriate approved contract form, determined by the contract type and amount, shall be used to document all sole source purchases. The contract manager and requesting department or elected official will negotiate a final contract document, obtain all requisite attachments and
vendor
signatures, and present the proposed contract to the
BOCC
or authorized delegate for approval.
1.
All contract forms will be written or approved by the county attorney’s office.
2.
Unless otherwise approved by the finance director, no contract will be submitted for approval by the BOCC or its delegate until it is ready for signature.
3.
Any work performed in accordance with the contract prior to approval is undertaken at the vendor’s sole risk and will not be paid for if the contract is not approved.
H.
Payment processing
. Payment of invoices submitted for sole source purchases are processed in the same manner as payments for standard purchases when the sole source contract is more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), and as payments for simplified purchases when the sole source contract is fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or less. Instead of a
documented quote
, however, and for both standard and simplified purchases, the sole source justification must be attached to the
purchase requisition
.
II.
Emergency purchases
. An
emergency purchase
is a purchase made in response to a condition that creates a threat to public health, welfare, or safety such as may arise by: reason of fire, flood, avalanche, epidemic, pandemic, riot, equipment failure, motor vehicle, airplane or rail accidents, hazardous spills or other occurrence or imminent threat of widespread or severe damage, injury or loss of life or property resulting from any nature or human cause that creates an immediate and serious need for
supplies
or services.
A.
General rules
. Emergency procurement shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. Persons authorized to make emergency purchases shall request assistance of the procurement division, as much as practicable, especially in prolonged emergency situations. The basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular contractor shall be maintained as a public record with payment records. The county's standard form agreements shall be used whenever possible.
B.
Limitations on purchase
. An emergency purchase shall be limited only to a quantity of those
supplies
, equipment, materials, or services necessary to meet the emergency.
C.
Review of emergency.
If the follow-up review of an emergency purchase indicates that the purchase was not necessary to respond to an emergency, the purchase will be referred to the county manager for appropriate resolution.
D.
Emergencies without an emergency operations center (“EOC”)
. When an emergency arises or occurs for which no EOC is established, such as is the case of equipment failure in a county facility, and the functions and operations of a county department or elected official’s office would be seriously hampered or delayed through use of the otherwise applicable procurement process, emergency purchases may be made by the same individuals as otherwise set forth in this code so long as funds budgeted in the then-current year in the county’s general fund are available to the person making the purchase. Further, the county manager may authorize and execute emergency purchases of up to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) for any single emergency event without additional approval from the BOCC so long as sufficient budgeted and appropriated funds are available in the county’s contingency fund.
E.
Emergencies with an established EOC
. When an emergency arises or occurs for which an EOC is established, including but not limited to those emergencies as determined or proclaimed by the President of the United States, Governor of Colorado, BOCC, La Plata County Sheriff, or county manager, the following individuals have authority to make emergency purchases under this code:
1.
La Plata County Sheriff or Undersheriff
.
Contracts
and a
greements
totaling fifty thousand dollars or less ($50,000.00) for any single emergency event, the purpose of which is to provide emergency response to both natural and manmade emergencies may be authorized and executed by the La Plata County Sheriff or Undersheriff without other approval so long as sufficient budgeted and appropriated funds are available in the Sheriff’s budget.
2.
Director of the office of emergency management, department heads and other elected officials
. The director of the office of emergency management, department heads and other
elected officials
, or their designees, may request approval to make emergency purchases of goods or services, with budgeted and appropriated funds available to such department head or elected official in the county’s general fund, when a threat to public health, welfare, or safety exists and the need cannot be met through normal
procurement
methods Requests shall be made to, and written approval obtained from, the county EOC’s logistics section and finance section chiefs prior to making any emergency purchase. Further, the county manager may authorize and execute emergency purchases of up to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) for any single emergency event without additional approval from the BOCC so long as sufficient budgeted and appropriated funds are available in the county’s contingency fund.
The individual authorizing the emergency purchase shall inform the county manager and the finance director of the emergency purchase no later than the first working day following the purchase.

I.
General rule
. Small purchases may be made on the open market without public notice or competitive quotes when the price paid is objectively consistent with the price that would be paid by a member of the general public. All small purchases must meet the following criteria:

1.
Appropriate s
olicitation
standards could include evidence that price comparisons were conducted or evidence of what a member of the general public would pay when purchasing a like good or service, such as an internet price sheet, a catalog price list, or newspaper advertisement.
2.
Each department head or elected official is responsible for ensuring that all purchases are properly documented and signed. Examples of acceptable contract forms for small purchases include: a contractor invoice,
purchase order,
proof of purchase, P-Card statement, inventory list, or vendor contract form.

.
I.
General rule
. Unless otherwise exempt from competitive
solicitation
pursuant to section 20-36, all simplified purchases must be
procured
either: (1) competitively through the
documented quote

. When the documented quote process is used, vendors may be notified of the specifications and terms and conditions by letter, email, telephone or in person; however, the method of contact must be documented, and steps must be taken to ensure that each vendor received the same information so that all responses are based upon equivalent information.
A documented quote is a written description of the actions undertaken to meet the
solicitation
standard and will be completed by procurement for each simplified purchase in which the process is used. Invoices will not be approved for payment in the absence of a documented quote or justification for use of the on-call list that includes the following:

proposal.
IV.
Green purchasing.
Pursuant to the county’s Environmental Policy, Policy No. V.11, as amended, where desirable, the procurement division may establish a price-preference of five (5) percent for
environmentally preferable products
by including a preference statement and standard by which to achieve preference in a specific IFB, RFP or other solicitation.
V.
State mandated processes and preferences.
Colorado law dictates solicitation and purchasing requirements and preferences in the following specific instances, which shall control over any contrary provisions of this
code
.
A.

B.
Work on county highways.
Contracts for work on county highways for more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), as such amount may be modified pursuant to C.R.S. § 43-2-209, as amended, must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder; provided, that the county reserves the right to reject any bids proffered.
C.

VI.
No preference given in certain circumstances.
No preference shall be given under this section if the finance director determines, in the finance director’s sole discretion, that awarding a contract in compliance with the preference provisions of this rule: (1) may cause a denial of state or federal money that would otherwise be available; (2) may otherwise be inconsistent with any requirement(s) applicable law or the purposes of this code; (3) may cause delay(s) in a procurement action that would compromise the public health, safety, or welfare of the county’s residents; (4) is redundant, as it would be in the case of a
sole source purchase
or
cooperative purchase
; or (5) is in direct conflict with federal
grant
or
procurement
procedures.

ARTICLE IV - SPECIFICATIONS AND SCOPES OF WORK
As discussed in article III, all
simplified
,
standard
, and
sole source purchases
begin with written
specifications
or a written
scope of work
(“SoW”). The importance of these documents to the quality of the
procurement process
, the eventual
contract
and, most important, the final result cannot be overstated.

ARTICLE IV SPECIFICATIONS AND SCOPES OF WORK
Sec. 20-41 General guidelines
Sec. 20-42 Scope of work
Sec. 20-43 Specifications
Secs. 20-44—20-50. Reserved
Sec. 20-41 General guidelines
I.
Importance of specifications and scopes of work.
A.
From a contractual standpoint, the
specifications
or
SoW
serves as one of if not the most important
contract
component. It establishes the expectations of the relationship. Further, in most instances, it is attached to and incorporated into the contract as an exhibit and, in such cases, is often the determining factor in resolving disputes over what work is or is not included in the project.
B.
From the county’s perspective, the specifications or SoW serves as the guideline for acquisition planning, selection of the appropriate
solicitation
method and identification of the correct contract terms. From a practical standpoint, the specifications or SoW is required to initiate the county’s internal acquisition planning process, which begins with a
purchase requisition
to which the specifications or SoW must be attached and concludes with the department’s or elected official’s ability to pay a
vendor’s
invoice.
C.
From a potential vendor’s perspective, the specifications or SoW serves as the basis upon which to plan and prepare a
responsive bid
or
proposal
. It communicates the nature and scope of the work to be done so that the responsive bid or proposal can be specifically and appropriately tailored.
II.
Differences between specifications and scopes of work.
A.
Scope of work.
As addressed in 20-42, a SoW is a written description of the result that the county seeks to achieve upon contract completion. A SoW describes “what” needs to be accomplished by the successful vendor as opposed to “how” the successful vendor shall do the work. In very broad terms, a SoW is used in connection with an
invitation for bid
,
request for proposals
or
request for qualifications
.
B.
Specifications
. As addressed in section 20-43, specifications emphasize the functional or performance criteria required to meet the county’s needs, such as specific quantities, qualities, materials, and the like. In very broad terms, specifications are used in connection with an invitation for bids, where contract
award
is determined based on the
lowest responsive and responsible bid
offer
, as discussed in article V.
III.
Maximum practicable competition
. Each specification or SoW shall be prepared and drafted in a manner to ensure maximum practicable competition in satisfying the county’s requirements, to promote overall economy for the purpose intended, and shall not be overly restrictive.
IV.
Preparation
. The department head,
elected official
, or their authorized designee is responsible for preparing the specification or SoW. The procurement division will work with departments and elected official’s offices to ensure each specification or SoW is as thorough and accurate as possible.
A.
Capital projects
. In the case of specifications or a SoW for capital projects, the
contract manager
will collaborate with the applicable department, the general services director and the county attorney to determine whether the specifications or SoW will be prepared internally or by contract with an architect or engineering consultant.
B.
Vendor assistance
. Obtaining vendor assistance to write specifications or SoWs is not common practice and should be avoided when possible because it may inhibit competition. If a vendor is involved in writing one of these documents, the vendor should be paid for the service and is generally prohibited from submitting a bid or proposal in response to the solicitation; provided that the finance director may allow the vendor to submit a bid or proposal if it is in the best interest of the county and is not otherwise prohibited by other applicable state or federal law. If an exception is made and the vendor is allowed to bid, its role in preparing the specifications shall be disclosed to other vendors as part of the solicitation documents.
C.
Funding source requirements
. Where purchases are funded from sources other than the county’s general fund, such as by state or federal
grants
, specific bidding or performance standards may be required of any sub-contractor or sub-recipient of such funds. As such, the department head or elected official shall provide any funding
agreements
, with the specifications or SoW, to the procurement division to ensure appropriate incorporation of such requirements into the procurement process.
(
Res. No. 2020-42, § 20-41, 12/17/2020
)
Effective on: 1/1/2021
Sec. 20-42 Scope of work
A S
oW
is a written description of the required
goods
or
service
s stated in terms of the result to be achieved.
I.
Purpose of a SoW
. The purpose of a SoW is to provide potential
vendors
with a clear, accurate, and complete description of the work to be performed, including: inspections, testing and acceptance, quality requirements, support services, critical time line definitions, data and documentation desired, maintenance and other necessary requirements.
II.
Elements of a SoW
. Every SoW should be expressly tailored for each specific purchase. There are, however, several common elements that should be addressed in every SoW whenever applicable:
A.
The work
. Describe the work sought, including any work plan, required deliverables, milestones, performance standards and due dates.
B.
Period of performance
. List the start and end date for the entire project as well as any other scheduling requirements.
C.
Physical location
. Identify or describe where the work will be performed. If the place of performance is at a specific address, identify it.
D.
Supplies and equipment.
List the
supplies
and equipment that will be required, used, or provided.
E.
Payment rate
. Identify how the payment rate for the good or service will be determined; for example, by job, month, day or hour.
F.
Acceptance criteria
. State the criteria the county representative(s) will use to determine if the product or service is acceptable.
G.
Special requirements
. Identify any special requirements that are required to successfully perform or complete the work, including, for example, any anticipated or allowable price increase over the term of the contract, any special hardware or software, specific degrees or certifications, travel requirements, delivery expectations, or any other need not covered by the contract that are necessary to the success of the project.

)
Effective on: 1/1/2021
Sec. 20-43 Specifications
Specifications
emphasize functional or performance criteria while limiting design or other detailed physical descriptions to those necessary to meet the county’s needs.
I.
Purpose of specifications
. The purpose of specifications is to serve as a basis for obtaining the
good
or
service
that is adequate and suitable to meet the county’s needs in a cost-effective manner considering, to the extent practicable, the costs of ownership and operation as well as initial acquisition costs.
II.
Form of specifications
. Specifications shall contain enough detail to provide for suitable purchases, without being unduly restrictive, and shall include the following information, where applicable:
A.
Functions and standards characteristics;
B.
Materials and methods descriptions;
C.
Shipment and delivery point requirements;
D.
Quality assurance and acceptance tests;
E.
Warranties and service support requirements;
F.
Product, supply and service specifications; and
G.
Environmental considerations in accordance with county policy.
III.
Preference for commercially available products
. To the extent practicable, preference shall be given to
procurement
of standard commercial products. In developing specifications, accepted commercial standards should be used and unique requirements should be avoided where possible.
IV.
Brand name or equal specifications – conditions for use
. “
Brand name
or equal” specifications may be used when the item to be procured is best described using such a specification and when the finance director, through acquisition planning, determines that it is in the
best interest of the county
.
A.
“Brand name or equal” specifications shall seek to designate as many different brands or “equal” references as are practicable and shall further state any substantially equivalent products that will be considered for
award
.
B.
Where a “brand name or equal” specification is used in a solicitation, the solicitation shall contain explanatory language that the use of a brand name is for the purpose of describing the standard of quality, performance, and characteristics desired and is not intended to limit or restrict competition.
V.
Brand name only specifications – conditions for use
. Since use of a
brand name only specification
is restrictive, it may be used only when the brand name or items will satisfy the department’s or elected official’s needs and the finance director determines in writing that one of the following criteria are satisfied.
A.
Criteria for brand name only specification:
1.
No other design or performance specification or qualified products list is available.
2.
Time does not permit the preparation of another form of product description that does not include a brand name specification.
3.
The nature of the product or the nature of the county’s requirements makes use of a brand name specification suitable for the procurement.
4.
Use of a brand name is in the county's best interest due to such concerns as standardization or compatibility with existing products used by other departments or elected officials.
B.
Brand name only specifications should not be confused with the situation that arises if only one source can supply the good or service. When only one source can supply the good or service, the procurement shall be made under the s
ole source purchase
policy set forth in section 20-36.
C.
Where a brand name only specification is used in a
solicitation
, the solicitation shall contain explanatory language that the use of a brand name is for the purpose of describing the standard of quality, performance, and characteristics desired and is not intended to limit or restrict competition.

ARTICLE V METHODS OF COMPETITIVE SOURCE SELECTION FOR STANDARD PURCHASES
This article describes the appropriate methods of competitive source selection for
standard purchases
(i.e., purchases with a contract requirement of more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). Generally, while
IFBs
or
RFPs
will be used, the
contract manager
in consultation with the finance director, may also determine that an
RFI
,
RFQ
or other tools should also be utilized. When such tools are used, the procurement division will outline the process to be used, in writing, prior to letting a
solicitation
. The provisions of this article do not apply to the source selection methods applicable to
small purchases
or
simplified purchases
.
Sec. 20-51 Bid security
Bid security is submitted as a guaranty that a
bid
or an
offer
will be maintained in full force and effect for a period of not less than sixty (60) days after opening of the bids or offers, or such other timeframe as specified in the
solicitation
.
I.
Requirement for bid security is discretionary.
Bid security may be required for any standard purchase at the discretion of the finance director in an amount not to exceed five (5) percent of the
contract
amount.
II.
Rejection of proposals for noncompliance
. If a
bidder
or offeror fails to accompany its bid or
proposal
with the required bid security, the bid or offer shall be rejected as non-responsive.
III.
Withdrawal of bids or proposals that require bid security
. After bids and proposals requiring security are opened, they shall be irrevocable for the period specified in the
IFB
,
RFP
or other solicitation package, unless withdrawal is specifically permitted by the finance director in writing. If a bidder or offeror is permitted to withdraw its bid or proposal before
award
, no action shall be taken against the bid security.
IV.
Acceptable bid security
. Acceptable bid security shall be limited to:
A.
A one-time bid bond underwritten by a company licensed to issue bonds in the State of Colorado;
B.
A bank cashier’s check made payable to La Plata County;
C.
A bank certified check or cashier’s check made payable to La Plata County; or
D.
An irrevocable letter of credit in a form acceptable to the county.
V.
Return of bid security
. Upon award of a contract and execution of the same to the successful bidder or offeror, bid security will be returned to all unsuccessful bidders who have not forfeited such bid security, as set forth below, within fifteen (15) business days of the county’s receipt of the executed contract with the successful bidder. Bid security will also be returned to the bidder or offeror awarded the contract within fifteen (15) business days of the county’s receipt of the executed contract; provided that this in no way will relieve the successful bidder or offeror from providing any additional required
performance bond
.
VI.
Forfeit of bid security
. A bidder or offeror will forfeit the bid security to the county if they withdraw their bid/proposal after bids/proposals are opened; unless expressly permitted in writing by the
contract manager
; fail to execute a contract after the notice of award is issued; fail to provide proof of necessary insurance and other assurances required by the award or contract; or fail to provide any performance and
payment bonds
that may be required.

Sec. 20-52 Invitation for bids
An
invitation for bids
(“IFB”) is the formal process used to
solicit
bids
from qualified
vendors
for
goods
and, in some cases for
services
, when complete
specifications
or specific purchase descriptions are available, and a measurable task or item is desired. The
contract
is awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, after considering any bid preferences as described in article III.
I.
General rule
. An IFB shall be used to solicit bids for all purchases of more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) when complete specifications or purchase descriptions are available. The specifications for the items to be procured are not subject to negotiation.
II.
Requirements of an IFB
. In consultation with the responsible department or
elected official
, the
contract manager
will prepare and publish an IFB solicitation package that shall include, at a minimum:
A.
Instructions and information to
bidders
concerning the bid submission requirements, including the time and closing date and the address of the office to which bids are to be delivered;
B.
The project description (furnished by the department or office), including the specifications or
SoW
and all drawings;
C.
The basis of
award
, including the award and evaluation criteria to be used;

A list of all applicable deadlines, including any applicable delivery or performance schedule.
III.
Public notice -
advertisement
. Public notice of the opportunity to bid is required for any procurement utilizing the IFB process. The opportunity to bid must be published in a newspaper(s) of relevant geographic circulation or other publication(s) directed to the target vendor market on at least two (2) occasions no less than ten (10) days prior to the date set for
bid opening
. Public notice shall be adequate if it contains:
A.
The project name;
B.
A brief description of the goods or services desired;
C.
The closing date and time for receiving bids;
D.
The place where bid packets may be obtained;
E.
The name of the person to contact for information;
F.
Date, time and location of any pre-bid conferences;
G.
Any special instructions to bidders (such as information about whether prequalification is required or the cost of bid packets) or information about where the same may be obtained;
H.
A statement regarding the bidder’s responsibility for determining the date of the award of bid and being heard on the award, if so desired;
I.
A statement regarding the county’s right to waive
minor deviations
or informalities, amend or cancel any bid solicitation, reject all bids and accept the lowest responsive and responsible bid; and
J.
A reference to this
code
and any standardized contracts, incorporating them into the bid process, unless otherwise stated.
IV.
Communication with bidders
. Once an IFB is made public, and through the time of contract award, all communication regarding the invitation shall be documented and directed to the contract manager. Unless otherwise set forth in the notice of the bid opportunity, the bid opportunity shall not be discussed with a potential bidder by any other county employee.
V.
Receipt of bids
. The time and date for receipt of bids shall be included in the IFB and must state a specific time on a certain date. Bids received after the specified time on such date will be considered late and not accepted. All submitted bids must be
sealed
and shall be received without alteration or correction, except as specifically authorized elsewhere in this code. Bids shall not be opened upon receipt.
VI.
Withdrawal of bids
. Withdrawal or modification of bids may be made by any bidder prior to the established due date and time for such bids upon written request from the bidder. Withdrawal of bids after the due date and time by prior to the time of award may be permitted, provided:
A.
The bidder provides evidentiary proof that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made in the costs or other material matter provided;
B.
The mistake is clear in the bid; or
C.
It is found by the finance director to be unconscionable not to allow the bid to be withdrawn.
Any decisions to permit or deny a request to withdraw a bid after the due date and time but before the time of award shall be supported by written documentation prepared by the finance director.
VII.
Amendment to or cancellation of an IFB; rejection of bid
. The contract manager may amend or cancel an IFB or reject a bid response by a
vendor
, in whole or in part, when it is in the
best interest of the county
. Each solicitation issued by the county shall state that the solicitation may be amended or cancelled and that any bid response to a solicitation issued by the county may be rejected, in whole or in part, when in the best interest of the county. If an amendment is made after the IFP is let, it shall be distributed to all bidders who submit bids and posted on the Rocky Mountain ePurchasing system, if applicable. If the solicitation is cancelled, notice of cancellation shall be sent to all offerors and posted on the Rocky Mountain ePurchasing system, along with the reasons cancellation was determined to be in the county’s best interest.
VIII.
Bid opening
. Bids shall be publicly opened in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the IFB. Public participation may be by remote means only, as determined by the county and designated in the IFB. The name of the bidder and amount of each bid, and any other information deemed relevant by the contract manager or designee, shall be read aloud and recorded. This bid record will become subject to public records requests upon contract award. Since each bid is subject to analysis, legal review, and appropriate approvals prior to contract award, no acceptance of any bid offer will take place at the bid opening and no bids will be publicly released prior to award.
IX.
Bid evaluation
. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the solicitation package. Prior to confirmation of an award, the contract manager may contact potential vendors responding to the bid request for the purpose of obtaining clarification to assure a full understanding of, and conformance to, the solicitation requirements. Any questions or concerns regarding cost reasonableness may be addressed by the contract manager or finance director in the manner deemed to be in the best interest of the county. The county reserves the right to waive minor deviations or informalities in reviewing bids.
X.
Budget
. If all bids received from responsible bidders exceed the funds
budgeted
for the acquisition, the county is not required to award a contract. If, however, time or economic considerations preclude the re-solicitation of bids, the finance director is authorized to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the lowest responsive and responsible bidder.
XI.
Determination of non-responsibility
. If a bidder who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found not responsible, the finance director shall prepare a written determination of non-responsibility, setting forth the basis of the finding. A copy of the determination shall be sent promptly to the non-responsible bidder. The final determination shall be made part of the contract file.
XII.
Award
. A recommendation that the county award a contract determined to be in the best interest of the county shall be made by the contract manager and department head or elected official, as applicable, with reasonable promptness and presented to appropriate county personnel, in accordance with the county’s Fiscal Management Policy No. III.4, as amended, for consideration and execution. Upon approval, notice of award is sent to the successful bidder, along with all documents required to finalize the contract terms.

Sec. 20-53   Request for proposals
A
request for proposals
(“RFP”) is the formal process used to solicit
proposals
from
qualified vendors
for
services
, and in some cases for
goods
, when the
specification
is a desired outcome rather than a measurable task or item.
I.
General rule
. An RFP is used to solicit proposals from potential
vendors
when a desired outcome is known and recommendations about how to achieve that outcome are requested.
Award
of the
contract
is based upon criteria other than or in addition to price, including what is in the
best interest of the county
. The terms of the proposals upon submission are open to negotiation. The response to an RFP is referred to as both “a proposal” and “an
offer
”.
II.
Requirements of an RFP
. The
contract manager
will prepare and publish an RFP
solicitation
package in consultation with the responsible department head or
elected official
, and the package shall include, at a minimum:
A.
Instructions and information to the proposer concerning proposal submission requirements, including the time and closing date and the address of the office to which proposals are to be delivered;
B.
Accurate and thorough description (prepared by the department or elected official’s office) of the project specifications or
SoW
and all drawings;
C.
The basis of the award, including the award and evaluation factors to be used;
D.
Required warranty and bonding or security requirements and insurance requirements;
E.
Inspection and acceptance requirements; and
F.
A schedule of all deadlines and key dates, including any applicable delivery or performance schedule.
III.
When an RFP is practical
. The RFP process is a time consuming and costly method of
procurement
that should be used only when
invitation for bids
is not appropriate.
Factors that may be helpful in deciding whether the RFP method is practical include, but are not limited to:
A.
The estimated contract value is more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00);
B.
The requirement is highly technical, unusual, is not a standard “off the shelf” item or there are little or no clear standards or specifications available to use in the solicitation;
C.
The terms of the contract require that payment be other than a fixed price;
D.
It is desired or necessary to conduct oral or written discussions with the offerors concerning technical and price aspects of their proposals;
E.
It may be necessary to afford offerors the opportunity to revise their proposals;
F.
It may be necessary to base an award on a comparative evaluation of price, quality and contractual factors in order to determine the most advantageous offering to the county;
G.
The primary considerations for award are factors other than price.
IV.
When an RFP is advantageous
. Factors that may be helpful in determining whether the RFP method is advantageous include, but are not limited to:
A.
If prior procurements indicate that
competitive sealed proposals
result in more beneficial contracts for the county;
B.
If the requirement is highly technical or complex in nature and it would be more advantageous to the county to use the RFP method of source selection.
V.
Public notice –
advertisement
.
Public notice of the opportunity to submit proposals is required for any procurement utilizing the RFP process. The opportunity to submit proposals must be published in a newspaper(s) of relevant geographic circulation or other publication(s) directed to the target vendor market on at least two (2) occasions no less than ten (10) days prior to the date proposals are due. Public notice shall be considered adequate if it contains:
A.
The project name;
B.
A brief description of the goods or services desired;
C.
The closing date and time for receiving proposals;
D.
The place where proposal packets may be obtained;
E.
The name of the person to contact for information;
F.
Date, time and location of any pre-proposal conferences;
G.
Any special instructions to vendors (such as information about whether prequalification is required or the cost of solicitation packets) or information about where the same may be obtained;
H.
A statement regarding the vendor’s responsibility for determining the date of the award (and being heard on the award, if so desired);
I.
A statement regarding the county’s right to waive
minor deviations or informalities
, amend or cancel any solicitation, reject all proposals and accept the proposal deemed most advantageous to the county; and
J.
A reference to this
code
and any standardized contracts, incorporating them into the bid process, unless otherwise stated.
VI.
Communication with vendors
. Once an RFP is made public, all communication regarding the solicited request shall be documented and directed to the contract manager. Unless otherwise set forth in this code or the notice of the opportunity to submit proposals, the RFP shall not be discussed with a potential vendor by any other county employee.
VII.
Receipt of proposals
. The time and date for receipt of proposals shall be included in the RFP and must state a specific time on a certain date. Proposals received after the specified time on such date will be considered late and not accepted. All submitted proposals must be
sealed
and shall be stored in a secure place until opening time. Proposals shall not be opened upon receipt.
Proposals will
not
be opened publicly
.
VIII.
Modification or withdrawal of proposals
. Proposals may be modified or withdrawn by any offeror prior to the established due date and time for such proposal. Withdrawal of proposals after the due date and time by prior to the time of award may be permitted, provided:
A.
The offeror provides evidentiary proof that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made in the costs or other material matter provided; or
B.
The mistake is clear in the proposal; or
C.
It is found by the finance director to be unconscionable not to allow the proposal to be withdrawn.
Any decisions to permit or deny a request to withdraw a proposal after the due date and time but before the time of award shall be supported by written documentation prepared by the finance director.
IX.
Amendment or cancellation of an RFP; rejection of proposals
. The contract manager may amend or cancel an RFP or reject a proposal submitted by a vendor, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the county. Each solicitation issued by the county shall state that the solicitation may be amended or cancelled and that any vendor response to a solicitation may be rejected, in whole or in part, when in the best interest of the county. If an amendment to the RFP after the solicitation is let, it shall be distributed to all offerors who submit proposals and posted on the Rocky Mountain ePurchasing system, if applicable. If the solicitation is cancelled, notice of cancellation shall be sent to all offerors and posted on the Rocky Mountain ePurchasing system, along with the reasons cancellation was determined to be in the county’s best interest.
X.
Evaluation factors
. The RFP shall clearly define all evaluation criteria, including price. Numerical rating systems or weights may be used but are not mandatory; however, if they are used, the points or weights must be assigned prior to evaluating the proposals.
XI.
Competitive range determination
. Competitive range refers to those proposals, as determined during the initial evaluation process for competitive negotiation, that includes only those offers with a reasonable chance of being selected for award and that may be considered for further discussion via interviews or written clarification. The competitive range shall be determined based on criteria stated in the RFP. The determination shall include all proposals that have a reasonable chance of being selected for award. When there is doubt as to whether a proposal is in fact within the competitive range, the proposal shall be included.
A.
Bid preferences only apply to the scoring of each proposal to determine whether they fall within the competitive range. Once the competitive range is identified, no additional bid preference applies.
XII.
Evaluation process
. The RFP evaluation process shall be conducted as a fair and objective process that requires evaluation of all proposals on the specific criteria stated in the RFP and not on any other criteria.
A.
Confidentiality is vital to fair and equitable evaluation. During the entire RFP process, the procurement division serves as the sole contact for vendors and provides all RFP procedures and communication. Vendor information, number of proposals received, results and other evaluation proceedings should always be kept confidential during the award process. Following contract award, this information may become a public record available for inspection in accordance with state statute and the county’s Open Records Policy.
B.
Single proposal received. If only one proposal is received in response to an RFP, the contract manager may:
1.
Determine if there was enough time allotted for offerors to submit a proposal. If not, the solicitation may be amended to extend the receipt of proposal date and the only proposal received shall be returned unopened to the only offeror;
2.
Proceed with the evaluation of the proposal from the single offeror. If the offer meets the requirements stated in the RFP and the cost is determined to be fair and reasonable through negotiations, an award may be made; or
3.
If the evaluation determines that the only offeror does not meet the county’s needs, or negotiations of the cost does not result in a fair and reasonable price, then the solicitation may be cancelled and re-solicited later.
XIII.
Selection committee/project manager.
Generally, a selection committee of three (3) or five (5) county employees will be appointed by the department head or elected official to evaluate all submitted proposals. However, with approval of the contract manager in certain circumstances, the department head or elected official may decide that the person(s) who will act as the project manager will have the sole responsibility for evaluating the submitted proposals. When the project manager evaluates proposals, the project manager will follow all standards set for the selection committee in this section.
A.
Purpose. The purpose of the selection committee is to ensure that proposals are reviewed based on the evaluation criteria alone in a consistent and fair manner with a maximum degree of professionalism.
B.
Eligibility. With the exception of staff members of the procurement division, any full-time county employee who is willing and who agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the selection process is eligible to serve on a selection committee; provided, however, that employees of the county attorney’s office may only serve on a selection committee with the permission of the county attorney and only for solicitations where the county attorney deems there to be a particular need for legal counsel on the selection committee.
1.
Selection committees should consist of at least one (1) member who is not part of the department that requested the RFP.
2.
Procurement division staff facilitates the evaluation process and may not be members of the selection committee.
3.
If any
BOCC
member serves on a selection committee, they shall recuse themselves from the final approval of a contract selected by the selection committee.
C.
Responsibilities.
1.
Each member of the selection committee will be assigned a number and will receive a copy of the solicitation package, a correspondingly numbered copy of each proposal, and a score card on which to score each proposal based on the stated criteria.
a.
The scoring must be based solely on information contained in the proposal and not upon additional information, including any personal knowledge or relationship, unless such information is included as a scoring criterion.
2.
Once each member has scored each proposal, the score sheets will be tallied by and accounted for by the contract manager. The selection committee may complete the scoring of each proposal in a collaborative means facilitated by the contract manager.
3.
Based upon the combined scores of the members, a selection committee representative will complete a decision form that lists the names of the selection committee members, states the results of the scoring, is signed by the selection committee representative, and is returned to the contract manager.
4.
The results of the scoring by the selection committee shall be totaled and any bid preference, as set forth in article III, will be applied to determine the overall highest scored/rated proposal.
XIV.
Written clarifications or interviews
.
The purpose of interviews and written clarifications is to allow the selection committee to differentiate between offerors otherwise similarly situated, as for example, those offerors who fall within the
competitive range
. Interviews may or may not be a part of the source selection process.
A.
Planned interviews. If interviews are intended to be a part of the evaluation criteria, the RFP must contain language that allows for them. The selection committee, prior to entering into discussions with any offerors, will make competitive range determinations. All offerors determined to be within the competitive range may be given an opportunity to interview.
B.
Potential interviews. If interviews were not originally intended but the selection committee determines that a contract award cannot be made on the initial proposals as submitted, the selection committee may request written clarifications or interviews with all responsible offerors within the competitive range. The following are examples of topics that may be appropriate for such follow-up:
1.
Attempt to resolve or clarify any uncertainties in the offerors’ proposals;
2.
Resolve any suspected mistakes. When it appears from a review of the proposal that a mistake has been made, an offeror should be asked to confirm the proposal. Situations in which confirmation should be requested include apparent errors or a price unreasonably lower than other submitted proposals. Upon acknowledgment that an error was made, the vendor may have its proposal considered as-is or may request to withdraw its response if the conditions set forth in subsection (VIII) of this section are met.
3.
Provide each offeror a reasonable opportunity to discuss past performance information obtained from references. Names of individuals providing reference information shall not be disclosed; or
4.
Provide each offeror a reasonable opportunity to submit revisions to both their technical proposals and price proposals by requiring submission of best and final offers by each offeror within the competitive range at the conclusion of the discussions.
C.
All offerors determined to be within the competitive range will be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals prior to award and for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers.
D.
Interviews and written clarifications should not be used to:
1.
Help one proposal rise to the level of other proposals;
2.
Use “auction techniques” such as indicating a cost or price an offeror must meet to be considered;
3.
Advise an offeror of its price standing relative to other offerors; or
4.
Provide any information about other offerors’ prices.
XV.
Best and final offers
. Upon completion of any interviews, the selection committee may issue to all offerors within the competitive range a request for best and final offers. Oral requests for best and final offers shall be confirmed in writing.
A.
The request shall include:
1.
Notice that discussions are concluded;
2.
Notice of the opportunity to submit a best and final offer; provided that it is made clear to offerors that submittal of a revised best and final offer is not mandatory. If no revision is submitted, the offeror’s original proposal will be considered; and
3.
Notice of the due date and time for submission of best and final offer.
B.
After receipt of best and final offers, the selection committee shall evaluate them accordingly and recommend that an award be made to the offeror whose final proposal is most advantageous to the county, considering price and the other factors included in the RFP.
XVI.
Award
. Selection for award will be based on scoring criteria specified in the RFP and evaluation of submitted proposals, as set forth above. The county reserves the right to enter contractual negotiations with the highest ranked firm selected by the selection committee. If a mutually agreeable contract cannot be negotiated to meet the county’s needs, the county reserves the right to enter negotiations with the second highest ranked firm, and so on. Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to be most advantageous to, and in the best interest of, the county, based on the evaluation factors set forth in the RFP and ability to contract with the offeror. An award recommendation shall be made by the contract manager and department head or elected official, as applicable, with reasonable promptness and presented to appropriate county personnel for consideration and execution, in accordance with the county’s Fiscal Management Policy No. III.4, as amended. Upon approval, notice of award is sent to the successful bidder, along with all documents required to finalize the contract terms.
XVII.
Post award de-brief
. Offerors submitting an unsuccessful proposal may, within five (5) business days of the date notification of award is published via the Rocky Mountain ePurchasing system, request a meeting for debriefing and discussion of their proposals. The request must be submitted in writing and addressed to the contract manager.

Effective on: 1/1/2021
Sec. 20-54   Unsolicited proposals and vendor shows
An
unsolicited proposal
is an
offer
made by a third party to sell
goods
or
services
to the county that has not been solicited or published by the county.
I.
General rule
. An offer to sell a good or service to the county in the absence of a county defined need,
SoW,
public notice or appropriate source selection must be properly evaluated before further action. Proper evaluation includes the following:
A.
All unsolicited proposal to sell goods or services to the county, regardless of who they are initially directed to, including the
BOCC
, shall be forwarded to the procurement division.
B.
The procurement division will make an initial evaluation of the offer and will either reject the offer or will forward the offer to an appropriate department head or
elected official
to determine: (1) if the offer meets a county need or provides a benefit that serves the
best interest of the county
; and (2) whether there are sufficient resources, including an appropriate
budget
, to make and manage the purchase.
C.
If the procurement division and department head or elected official decide to pursue the offer, they must then determine if the offer qualifies for a
sole source justification
, defined in article III above.
1.
If so, the unsolicited proposal may be accepted by complying with the
sole source purchase
process and standards.
2.
If the offer does not qualify for a sole source justification but the opportunity is deemed to be worth exploring, then article III will dictate the way the opportunity is to be sourced and
awarded
. Before solicitation, the original
proposal
should be rejected and the pending opportunity to submit a new proposal explained. In this instance, the party who submitted the unsolicited proposal would be required to submit a new responsive proposal and would be evaluated in the same manner as any other
bidder
or offeror.
II.
Vendor shows
.
Vendor
shows, which include open houses, product exhibits or product demonstrations, must be approved in advance by Procurement in order to protect the integrity of the
procurement process
, viability of current
agreements
, and ensure fairness to all potential vendors. A product demonstration of a good already contracted for is not a vendor show. The finance director will have final authority to determine what constitutes a vendor show.

Effective on: 1/1/2021
Sec. 20-55   Other methods of competitive source selection
The
contract manager
may recommend and utilize, upon approval of the finance director, any other form of competitive source
solicitation
, such as by way of example only, a
competitive reverse auction
, a
request for information
or a
request for qualifications,
when such an alternative may be better suited to meet a specific need or ensure the best value to the county. If an alternative solicitation method is followed, a written explanation of the reasons and the process followed shall be included in the
contract
file.

I.
Timing
. Upon
contract
award
, information contained in
bids
and
proposals
that is retained by the county becomes subject to requests for inspection in accordance with the CORA.
II.
Documents labeled as confidential
. If the county receives an open records request that covers information included in a bid or proposal that has been designated as a trade-secret, proprietary or otherwise “confidential,” by a
bidder
, offeror,
vendor
or
contractor
, the contract manager will examine the designated documents to determine if they should be protected from disclosure.
A.
If some or all of the information reviewed contains information, identified and marked as
confidential information
by the bidder, offeror, vendor or contractor in writing, the procurement division will not disclose the information; provided that the bidder, offeror, vendor or contractor agrees to indemnify, save and hold the county harmless from any claims, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees and court costs, incurred based on withholding such information and data.
1.
No bid, proposal or contract may be considered confidential in its entirety. Any attempt to mark any entire document as such may result in rejection of a bid, proposal or other offer.
2.
Overall bid, proposal or contract prices will not be considered confidential.
B.
If the county and the offeror do not agree about whether information or documents should be made available based on the data provided by the bidder, offeror, vendor or contractor, the county will disclose what it deems appropriate unless the bidder, offeror, vendor or contractor agrees, in writing, to defend and indemnify the county for withholding such information.

specifications
or
SoW
or within the time limits provided in the contract; or
2.
A recent record of failure to satisfactorily perform in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts; provided that failure to perform due to acts beyond the control of the vendor or contractor shall not be a basis for debarment. The term "recent" for purposes of this subsection shall mean within the prior year or the last contract with the county, whichever is greater in time.
D.
Any other cause that the contract manager determines to be so serious and compelling as to affect responsibility as a county vendor, including debarment by another governmental entity for any cause;

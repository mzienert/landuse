Chapter 65 Animas Valley Zone Districts and Economic Development Areas
Overview
This
code
is premised upon
performance-based zoning
and the type of standards more particularly described in the overview of chapter 70. However, in the Animas Valley,
traditional zoning
has been adopted. This chapter contains detailed
use
,
density
and
lot
standards for
development
covered by the Animas Valley Land Use Plan (AVLUP). Applications for
development
in the Animas Valley should refer to this chapter to determine (1) if the proposed use is allowed and what type of review procedures apply, (2) what minimum
lot size
, maximum
density
, minimum
open space
and maximum
impervious coverage
standards may apply, and (3) whether any supplemental use,
density
and
development
standards are applicable because of the property’s location in the Animas Valley River Corridor District or one of several Animas Valley Neighborhood Overlay Zoning Districts.
This chapter is also intended to accommodate future placement of unique standards that may apply to economic
development
areas, once designated under section 66-38, or future overlay areas that may be adopted relative to requirements for
affordable housing
or other matters.

I.
Animas Valley Land Use Plan.
A.
Use. This section is to be used in conjunction with the
Animas Valley Land Use Map
.
B.
Basic plan provisions. The basic plan provisions are as follows:
1.
Any preexisting, legal lot of record made nonconforming by this plan shall be entitled to one
single-family residence
, uses that are customarily secondary to a single-family residence, including accessory uses, and other developments that do not require a land use permit as described in section 66-3 and other applicable provisions of this code.
2.
Any preexisting dwelling unit made nonconforming in terms of density shall enjoy the right of replacement unless the entire site is being redeveloped, at which time the entire site shall be made to conform to the plan.
3.
Uses made nonconforming shall enjoy the right to regular maintenance, repair and to some extent replacement and expansion, as provided in section 79-3.
4.
No new subdivisions shall occur on slopes of thirty (30) percent or greater. One (1) dwelling unit is permitted on any preexisting, legal lot of record lying on steep slopes. This subsection shall in no way supersede the county's geologic hazards map regulations.
5.
Accessory uses shall be allowed in all Animas Valley Land Use Plan Districts so long as meeting the standards established in section 73-2 and/or permitted pursuant to section 73-2.
C.
Use permitted by right. The developments listed as “uses permitted by right” for each of the districts shall not require land use permits.
D.
Special uses. Special uses shall require a minor land use permit meeting the standards identified in this chapter and any other applicable standards, as determined by the director, within this code.
E.
Conformance. Applications for development which are not in conformance with the Animas Valley Land Use Plan shall not be accepted by the
CDD
staff. To be submitted, the plan must first be amended to allow for the intended use or density. The process for amending the plan shall require a public hearing before the
planning commission
or joint planning commission, and a subsequent hearing before the board.
F.
Notification. Any development requiring a public hearing shall require a notification of surrounding landowners. For purposes of this provision, surrounding landowners shall include those owners of property within one thousand (1,000) feet of the property line of the lot or parcel subject to the application for a land use permit.

uses are not applicable in the AVLUP.

action results in a legal
contract
between the county and the supplier, regardless of purchase type or amount. This article VI discusses the appropriate contracts and terms to be used.
Sec. 20-64   Contract amendments and change orders
County officials shall not authorize any work outside of the contract. Any change or modification to a procurement
contract
shall be processed through the procurement division, executed by authorized county personnel as set forth in Fiscal Management Policy III.4, and shall include all requisite documentation and authorizations.
Change orders
shall not be used to circumvent the contracting authority delegated in article II or the purchase standards defined in article III. Change orders will not be issued for work that materially changes the nature or intent of the contract.

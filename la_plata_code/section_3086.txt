Chapter 70: General Site Development Standards Applicable to All Development
Sec. 70-1 Applicability
Chapter 70 of this code contains the general site development standards that are applicable to all development in the unincorporated county, provided, however, oil and gas development is subject to the provisions of chapter 90 of this code, including select provisions of this chapter 70. The standards in this chapter cover a wide variety of subject areas, including building setbacks and height, buffers, protection of critical lands and scenic resources, open space and parks, road design and vehicle access, off-street parking, outdoor lighting, neighborhood protection, utilities and services, and signs. The general site development standards of this chapter work together with the supplemental overlay standards in chapter 72, standards for specific uses in chapter 73, and the road standards in chapter 74 to comprise the substantive standards governing new development in the county. These standards are applied at all stages of the development review process and the applicant shall demonstrate compliance with all applicable standards. Unless otherwise specifically addressed by a section of this code, the development standards set forth in this chapter 70 shall apply to all new development on the effective date of this code.

If any commissioner owns or controls a financial interest, direct or indirect, in any property or in any concession, contract or proposed contract for materials or services associated with the airport, he or she shall immediately disclose the same in writing to the airport commission, and such disclosure shall be entered upon the minutes of the airport commission. Upon such disclosure, such commissioner shall recuse himself or herself and shall not participate in any action by the airport commission affecting the project, property, concession, or contract unless the airport commission determines that, in the light of and notwithstanding such personal interest, the participation of such member would not be contrary to the public interest. Acquisition or retention of any such interest without disclosure to the commission or participation with respect to a project, property, concession or contract without a determination by the airport commission that such participation is not contrary to the public interest shall constitute misconduct in office.

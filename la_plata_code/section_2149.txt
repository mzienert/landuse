I.
Investigation of complaints. Any complaint, i.e.,
patient
care, billing, litigation, etc., from any source, regarding an
ambulance service
will be referred to the county
emergency
medical services council for investigation. Notice will also go to the ambulance service named and the
Board of County Commissioners
.
For all complaints related to operators or services that are not operating pursuant to an authorization to operate issued by the
Board of County Commissioners
, the complaint will be forwarded by the county emergency medical services council to the appropriate state agency (and, if easily ascertainable, a county that has issued an applicable authorization to operate). For all complaints related to operators or services that are performed pursuant to an authorization to operate issued by the
Board of County Commissioners, th
e county emergency medical services council will see that a timely investigation occurs and a report filed with all the parties concerned. If after the initial investigation the county emergency medical services council believes that the
ambulance
company is in noncompliance with any of the provisions of this article or other applicable law, the county emergency medical services council shall contact the person in charge of the ambulance service in question and see if that person determines there is a problem. If the person in charge of the ambulance service determines there is a problem, there shall be an agreement as to what shall be done to immediately resolve the issue or to alleviate the problem within a specified time frame for correction not to exceed ten days depending upon the severity of the infraction. If the person in charge of the ambulance service determines there is no problem or otherwise refuses to enter into a mutually agreeable plan to resolve the issue but the county emergency medical services council believes there is still noncompliance, the county emergency medical services council will
prepare and submit a full report of the alleged noncompliance to the Board of County Commissioners, including copies of all relevant evidence related to the investigation. Pursuant to C.R.S. § 25-3.5-314(5)(e)(I), the Board of County Commissioners has and reserves the right to summarily suspend, without prior notice or hearing, any authorization to operate issued by the Board of County Commissioners for the maximum period allowed by state law. Following any notice and hearing required by law,  t
he
Board of County Commissioners
will make the final determinations regarding compliance, suspension, required plan for correction or possible
license
revocation.
II.
Grounds for suspension or revocation. Upon a determination by the
Board of County Commissioners
that any person has violated or failed to comply with any provision of this article, an authorization to operate, a memorandum of understanding with the county, or other applicable local, state, federal or tribal law or regulation, the
Board of County Commissioners
may
pursue any or all enforcement options available to it under law. Any information that would provide grounds to deny issuance of a state license, state permit, or county authorization to operate shall also be sufficient grounds to suspend or revoke an authorization to operate issued by the
Board of County Commissioners
.
III.
Notice of suspension or revocation. Notice of suspension or revocation shall be given by certified mailing to the licensee at the address contained in such license
and simultaneously to the state to comply with the noticing requirement of C.R.S. § 25-3.5-314(5)(e)(IV). Notices shall include supporting documentation for the board’s decision.

Sec. 26-142. Number of approved services and service areas.
The county is currently divided into 4 geographic areas as indicated in Appendix 26-142, each served by a fire protection district. Each fire protection district, with the assistance of its neighbors and others through mutual aid or other agreements, has provided ambulance services within its jurisdiction. The county’s needs for ambulance services are well served by fire protection districts, ambulance districts, and metropolitan districts organized within La Plata County under the Special District Act, C.R.S. §§ 32-1-101
et seq
. Without limiting the authority of the
Board of County Commissioners
to issue sufficient authorizations to operate as it determines is necessary to meet the needs for ambulance services within La Plata County, the
Board of County Commissioners
intends to limit the number of authorizations to operate to a maximum of one primary authorization to operate within each jurisdiction of a fire protection district, ambulance district, or metropolitan district organized within La Plata County under the Special District Act with authority to provide fire protection services and/or emergency medical services. Absent extraordinary conditions found by the
Board of County Commissioners
, the
Board of County Commissioners
does not intend to issue an authorization to operate to a person or entity that allows for ongoing and regular service within the jurisdiction of another fire protection district, ambulance district, or metropolitan district organized within La Plata County under the Special District Act with authority to provide fire protection services and/or emergency medical services unless supported by a written agreement signed by both entities that addresses the sharing of service responsibilities within the respective jurisdictions. The
Board of County Commissioners
will also entertain applications for authorizations to operate that propose new geographic areas or otherwise intend to serve within areas of the county that are not currently served within an existing fire protection district, ambulance district, or metropolitan district.

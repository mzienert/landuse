Sec. 54-61. Penalty assessment procedure.
I.
Penalty assessment notice. When a
person
is arrested for an offense as set forth in C.R.S § 30-15-402, as amended, the arresting officer
shall
issue the person a penalty assessment notice and release the person upon its terms. The penalty assessment notice, except as otherwise provided for in this section regarding illegally parked
vehicles
, shall be a summons and complaint containing identification of the alleged offender, specification of the offense and applicable fine, a requirement that the alleged offender pay the fine or appear to answer the charge at a specified time and place, and other matters reasonably adopted effectuating the purpose of this article.
II.
Acknowledgement or denial of guilt. If the person given a penalty assessment notice chooses to acknowledge his guilt, he
may
pay the specified fine in person or by mail at the place and within the time specified in the notice. If he chooses not to acknowledge his guilt, the defendant shall appear as required in the notice. Upon trial, if the alleged offender is found guilty, the fine imposed shall be that specified in the notice for the offense of which he was found guilty, but customary court costs may be assessed against him in
addition
to the fine.
III.
Notice on illegally parked vehicle. Whenever any motor vehicle without a driver is found parked or stopped in
violation
of any of the restrictions imposed by this article, the law enforcement officer finding such vehicle shall take its license plate number and state of registration of the vehicle, and may take any other information displayed on the vehicle which may identify its user, and shall conspicuously affix to such vehicle a penalty assessment notice, indicating the offense or infraction and directing the
owner or operator
of the vehicle to remit the penalty assessment provided for by this article for the offense or infraction specified, directing the driver thereof to respond to and answer the charge against him at a place and at a time specified in the notice.
IV.
Failure to comply with notice on parked vehicle. If the driver or
owner
of an unattended motor vehicle charged with an apparent violation of the restrictions on stopping, standing or parking under this article does not respond within the time specified to a penalty assessment notice affixed to such vehicle, as provided for in this section, by appearance and payment at the
county
court, or by mailing payment by means of the United States mail, or by other disposition of the charge as provided by law, the clerk of the county court shall send another notice by mail to the registered owner of the vehicle to which the original notice was affixed, warning him that if such notice is disregarded for a period of 20 days from date of mailing, a complaint will be filed and a warrant of arrest will be issued.
V.
Presumption in reference to illegal parking. In any prosecution charging a violation of any provision of this article governing the stopping, standing or parking of a vehicle, proof that the particular vehicle described in the complaint was parked in violation of this article, together with proof that the defendant named in the complaint was at the time of such parking the registered owner of such vehicle, shall constitute in evidence a prima facie presumption that the registered owner of such vehicle was the person who parked or placed such vehicle at the point where, and for the time during which, such violation occurred.

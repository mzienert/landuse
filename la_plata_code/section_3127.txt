This code shall be enforced in accordance with the requirements of Colorado law and as provided in this chapter. Any violation of the previous county land use code will continue to be a violation under this code and be subject to penalties and enforcement under this chapter, unless the use, development, construction, or other activity complies with the provisions of this code. Inaction or lack of enforcement on the part of the county shall not constitute a waiver of the right of enforcement. Enforcement action may occur based upon a complaint submitted by a member of the public or by a county official or employee, or on the county's own initiative.

Sec. 80-4 Right of entry and inspection
When a person charged with enforcement of this code has reasonable cause to believe any project or use is being conducted or any condition exists which is contrary to or in violation of this code or any condition of approval of a project, such person may enter and inspect or cause to be entered or inspected at reasonable times, any real property, lot, parcel, right-of-way, site, building, structure, improvement or other facility that is, or should be, subject to a land use permit to determine compliance with this code or the applicable land use permit. Such inspections may include the following:
I.
Observation
. Observations of the real property or use from those portions of the property which are open or accessible to the public, from public property, areas in which the owner or occupant lacks a reasonable expectation of privacy, or from other private property for which permission to enter has been obtained from an owner, agent or occupant.
II.
Entry pursuant to court order
. Entry onto the real property, lot, parcel, right-of-way, site, building, structure, improvement or other facility pursuant to a court order obtained after submitting a request for an administrative warrant or other order authorizing inspection which included an affidavit detailing the facts to support a reasonable belief that a violation is likely to exist, and further investigation of the property is warranted.
III.
Emergency
. Entry onto the real property, lot, parcel, right-of-way, site, building, structure, improvement or other facility in emergency situations in which a person authorized under this chapter to enforce the code has reason to believe the public health or safety is in imminent danger and could be jeopardized by any delay in securing entry.

Sec. 80-5 Enforcement options
This chapter generally sets forth the enforcement options available that may be taken by the persons authorized by this chapter to enforce the code to address violations. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the director, county attorney or board from exercising discretion to pursue one (1) or more option, remedies or any combination thereof, as provided by this code or Colorado law.
I.
Violation determinations
.
A.
Notice to correct violation. If reasonable cause exists to believe a violation has occurred, a notice to correct violation shall be sent certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner’s mailing address as listed in the records of the county assessor’s office and to the mailing address of the real property in question, if an address exists. The notice to correct violation shall state which requirements of the code or conditions of approval for the project are being violated, shall state the conditions that are to be satisfied for compliance and shall state the violations shall be corrected within thirty (30) days after the date of the notice. The notice to correct violation may require correction within a period less than thirty (30) days if the director determines the violation presents an immediate risk to the public health, safety and welfare. The director may approve additional time to correct the violation if good cause is shown.
B.
Violation determination. If the violation is not corrected within the period established in the notice to correct violation or approved extension of time, the director may issue a violation determination and authorize the county attorney to pursue the remedies described in this chapter or otherwise available by law, subject to appeal as set forth in subsection 80-5.IV. The director shall deliver the violation determination to the owner, occupant or alleged violator by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by posting the violation determination in a conspicuous location on the parcel, right-of-way, site, building, structure, improvement or other facility, if reasonably accessible. The director or the county attorney may also record the violation determination in the property records in the county clerk and recorder’s office. The violation determination shall:
1.
State the nature of the violation;
2.
State the date and manner of service of any previous notice to correct the violation;
3.
State that the owner, occupant or alleged violator may appeal the violation determination to the board within ten (10) days after the date of the violation determination and, in the absence of such appeal, the violation determination shall become final and the county attorney may pursue remedies under this chapter and other applicable law;
4.
Inform the owner, occupant or alleged violator that the appeal must be submitted to the director in writing.
II.
Stop order; immediate compliance
.
A.
Issuance of stop order. As an alternative to, or in addition to, the notice to correct violation described in this chapter, the director may, by written notice in the form of a “stop order”, order the activity or use stopped immediately. The issuance of a stop order is not a prerequisite to any other enforcement mechanism or remedies available to the county.
B.
Service of the stop order. The stop order shall be served, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to any person engaged in the activity, development or use, or to any person owning, leasing, occupying or controlling all or any portion of the parcel, right-of-way, site, building, structure, improvement or other facility, or by posting the order in a conspicuous location on the parcel, right-of-way, site, building, structure, improvement or other facility. The posted stop order shall not be removed until the violation is corrected.
C.
Compliance with order. All persons shall comply immediately with the stop order upon its service or posting.
D.
Contents of stop order. The stop order shall:
1.
State the nature of the violation and activity or use that must immediately cease;
2.
State that the owner, occupant or alleged violator may appeal the stop order to the board within three (3) business days after the date of the stop order and, in the absence of such appeal, the order shall become final and the county attorney may pursue remedies under this chapter and other applicable law if the stop order is violated;
3.
Inform the owner, occupant or alleged violator that the appeal must be submitted to the director in writing.
E.
Stop order lifted only by compliance order. The stop order shall remain in effect until the director determines the activity, development or condition that is the basis for the stop order has been remedied and the director issues a written compliance order or, alternatively the board lifts the stop order after conducting an appeal hearing consistent with the process described in subsection 80-5.IV, provided, however the timing and notice of the appeal hearing may be modified by the board or director to expedite the process due to the urgent nature of the situation.
F.
Failure to comply. If the stop order is violated, the director may authorize the county attorney to pursue the remedies described in this chapter or otherwise available by law, subject to appeal as described in subsection 80-5.IV.
III.
Temporary suspension or permanent revocation of permit.
The decision-making body may temporarily suspend or permanently revoke an approved land use permit. A suspension order shall remain in effect until the decision-making body issuing the suspension finds the activity or condition that is the basis for the suspension has been remedied, and the decision-making body issues a written compliance finding. Before making a temporary suspension or permanent revocation, the county shall give the owner written notice of the violation by certified mail, return receipt requested. The owner may appeal the temporary suspension or permanent revocation to the board within ten (10) days after the date of the suspension or revocation determination and, in the absence of such appeal, the suspension or revocation shall become final. Appeals of the suspension or revocation may be taken as described in subsection 80-5.IV. In the event of a permanent revocation, the director shall file a certified statement of revocation with the county clerk and recorder.
IV.
Appeal hearing
. If the dirdirectorector receives a timely appeal of the stop order, violation determination or temporary suspension or permanent revocation, the director shall place the matter on the board’s next available land use hearing agenda. The appealing party shall be notified of the date, time and place of the hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the appealing party’s mailing address as listed in the records of the county assessor’s office no less than five (5) days prior to the hearing.
At the appeal hearing, the appealing party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony to show cause why further enforcement action should not be taken. The board shall consider all such evidence and testimony, along with any presentation, evidence or testimony presented by the director or staff, in reaching its decision to affirm or overturn the decision to issue the stop order or violation determination.
Within five (5) business days after conclusion of the appeal hearing, the board may decide to overturn the decision or may affirm the decision and instruct the director or county attorney to proceed with one (1) or more of the enforcement mechanisms described in this chapter or otherwise available by law. The appeal hearing shall not be considered a quasi-judicial or legislative action under any circumstances.

Sec. 80-7 Subdivision violations
I.
False or inaccurate information provided, and final plat not recorded
. The board may take appropriate action to deny, suspend or withdraw any approval of a plan or plat, or to require that certain corrective measures be taken, following a determination that the information provided by the applicant upon which such approval was based is materially false or inaccurate or that new significant information has been brought to the board’s attention. The action may occur at any step in the platting process prior to the recording of the final plat and shall take place at a regular public hearing. The board shall determine at the hearing the nature and extent of the alleged false or inaccurate information, shall consider any new significant information that has been brought to its attention, and shall have the authority, upon good cause being shown, to deny the plan or plat or suspend or withdraw any approval or require corrective measures to be taken. No final action authorized by this section shall be taken unless the applicant is notified of and, if present at the public hearing, has an opportunity to respond to the proposed denial, suspension, withdrawal, or corrective action.
II.
False or inaccurate information provided, and plat recorded
. If it is determined after a plat approved by the board is filed for recording that the plat approval was based on materially false or inaccurate information, the board may take appropriate action to withdraw or reconsider the approval, to require corrective measures, or to void the plat, after a public hearing where adequate notice and opportunity to be heard are given to the applicant, any successor property owners, and any affected adjacent property owners, review agency, or service providers.
III.
Enforcement of plat restrictions.
Pursuant to C.R.S. § 30-28-137(4), the board or any purchaser of any lot or tract shall have the authority to bring an action for injunctive relief to enforce any plat restriction (including all obligations contained in documents required to be executed and recorded as part of the final plat approval and all commitments of record of the applicant related to the county's approval of the final plat), plat note, plat map, or provision of a development improvements agreement, and for damages arising out of failure to adhere to any such plat restriction, plat note, plat map, or provision of a development improvements agreement.
IV.
Sale of lots before plat recording.
Pursuant to C.R.S. § 30-28-110(4), it is unlawful to transfer legal or equitable title or sell any subdivided land as defined by this code before a final plat for the real property has been approved by the decision-making body and recorded with the county clerk and recorder. Any applicant or agent thereof who violates this provision is guilty of a misdemeanor. The county may also seek to enjoin any violations of this provision. The county shall not be liable for any direct or apparent fiscal losses suffered by any person as a result of denial of any subdivision, or disruption of a transfer or sale, where the applicant has agreed to transfer or sell or offered to transfer or sell any subdivided land in advance of plat approval by the decision-making body.
V.
Authority to withhold land use and building permits.
In addition to any other enforcement action specified in this code, pursuant to C.R.S. § 30-28-110(4)(a), the building official or the director is authorized to withhold or demand the withholding of the issuance of any building permit or related permit under this code sought or requested for real property for which a final plat (or equivalent) has not been approved or recorded or which is in violation of the approved final plat (or equivalent), including any plat note, condition or restriction or any commitment of record in the county's final plat (or equivalent) approval file.

Sec. 80-8 General provisions
I.
No waiver of statutory authority
. Nothing in this chapter is or shall be a waiver by the county of any statutory or common law authority including without limitation the authority identified in C.R.S. § 24-33.5-709 relating to local disaster emergencies.
II.
Burden of proof
. The burden of proof that an activity, development or a use complies with this code and all applicable conditions of approval or is legally nonconforming lies with the owner of the real property.
III.
Enforcement costs
. If the board affirms the director’s decision to issue a violation determination or stop order (or if either becomes final without an appeal), the costs of any county investigation of the violation and the costs of any hearing and board action, including reasonable attorney’s fees, shall be the responsibility of the owner of the real property and violator, jointly and severally, subject to court order.
IV.
Mitigation efforts
. Implementation of remedial efforts shall not relieve an owner’s, occupant’s or alleged violator’s responsibility to comply with all county standards and criteria or the project’s conditions of approval. Failure to conduct the project in compliance with county standards and criteria or all conditions of approval shall be deemed a land use permit violation.
V.
Land use application and violations
. An application for a land use permit, road access permit or driveway permit shall not be initiated or accepted for submittal if the property subject to the application is in violation of this code or the building code unless the purpose of the application is to correct the violation. The director may suspend any enforcement action prior to such action being heard by the board if a complete application to correct or resolve the violation has been submitted. A review fee, in addition to the application fee, shall be collected whether a permit is issued based on the application. The review fee shall be equal to three (3) times the amount of the application fee. Neither the payment of the review fee nor the filing of an application shall exempt any person from compliance with all other requirements of this code or relieve any person from any other enforcement remedies available to the county.

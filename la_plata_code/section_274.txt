Editor's note—
Res. No. 2014-36, § 5(Exh. A), adopted October 14, 2014, amended division 2 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, division 2 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Res. No. 2012-21, § 5(Exh. A), adopted October 14, 2012, and Res. No. 2014-04, § 1, adopted January 7, 2014.
Sec. 2-761. Scope.
The following investment policy addresses the methods, procedures and practices which must be exercised to ensure effective and judicious fiscal and investment
management
of the
county
's funds. This investment policy
shall
apply to the investment management of all financial assets and funds under
control
of the county except for retirement funds, deferred compensation funds, and debt reserve funds. This investment policy shall apply to trust and agency funds, although these funds are not included in general operating funds.
All cash, except for certain restricted and special accounts, shall be pooled for investment purposes. The investment income derived from the pooled investment account shall be allocated to the contributing funds based upon the proportion of their respective average balances relative to the total pooled balance.
(Res. No. 2014-36, § 5(Exh. A), 10-14-2014, Res. No. 2016-10)
Effective on: 6/14/2016
Sec. 2-762. Investment objectives.
The County’s funds shall be invested in accordance with all applicable County policies and State and Federal regulations.  Funds shall be invested in a manner designed to accomplish the following objectives which are listed in priority order:
Preservation of capital and protection of investment principal.
Maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet anticipated cash flow needs.
Attainment of a market rate of return.
Diversification to avoid incurring unreasonable risks.
(Res. No. 2014-36, § 5(Exh. A), 10-14-2014; Res. No. 2016-10)
Effective on: 6/14/2016
Sec. 2-763. Delegation of authority.
Responsibility for conducting investment transactions for the
county
resides with the county treasurer. The deputy treasurer and other authorized
persons
may
be appointed to assist the treasurer in performing investment
management
, cash management or treasury functions. Persons authorized to transact securities business for the county are listed in Annex I of this Investment Policy (section 2-776).
The treasurer
shall
establish written administrative procedures for the operation of the county's investment program consistent with this investment policy.
The treasurer may engage the support services of outside professionals. Such services may include engagement of financial advisors in conjunction with debt issuance, portfolio management support, special legal representation, third party custodial services, and independent rating services.
(Res. No. 2014-36, § 5(Exh. A), 10-14-2014; Res. No. 2016-10)
Effective on: 10/14/2014
Sec. 2-764. Prudence.
The standard of prudence to be used for managing the
county
's assets is the "prudent investor" rule, which states that a prudent investor "
shall
exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the
management
of the property of another, not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of capital." (C.R.S. § 15-1-304, Standard for Investments.)
The county's overall investment program shall be designed and managed with a degree of professionalism that is worthy of the public trust. The county recognizes that no investment is totally without risk and that the investment activities of the county are a matter of public record. Accordingly, the county recognizes that occasional measured losses
may
occur in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall portfolio's return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented and that the sale of a security is in the best long-term interest of the county.
The county treasurer and other authorized
persons
acting in accordance with written procedures and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes.
(Res. No. 2014-36, § 5(Exh. A), 10-14-2014; Res. No. 2016-10)
Effective on: 6/14/2016
Sec. 2-765. Ethics and conflicts of interest.
Elected officials and employees involved in the investment process
shall
refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program or which could impair or create the appearance of an impairment of their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees involved in the investment process shall disclose to the
county
treasurer any material financial interest they have in financial institutions that conduct business with the county, and they shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of the county.
(Res. No. 2014-36, § 5(Exh. A), 10-14-2014; Res. No. 2016-10)
Effective on: 6/14/2016

Chapter 79 Nonconformities
Sec. 79-8 Certification of nonconforming status
I.
Process
. Owners of nonconformities may request a certificate of nonconforming status by filing an application with the CDD in accordance with this section.
A.
Documentation provided by owner. The application shall be accompanied by documentation provided by the owner establishing the approximate date that the use, structure, or sign was constructed or established. The type of documentation that may assist in demonstrating an established use, structure, or sign include, but is not limited to:
1.
Tax records;
2.
Sworn affidavits;
3.
Maps and advertisements in dated publications;
4.
Dated statements from utilities;
5.
Dated aerial photographs;
6.
Building permits or septic permits;
7.
Telephone directory listings;
8.
Leases;
9.
Insurance policies;
10.
Dated newspaper articles.
The director may require additional information if necessary, to make an accurate determination. The county has no obligation to perform research on behalf of the applicant. If inadequate documentation exists for the director to conclusively determine legal nonconforming status, the director shall not be required to issue the certification.
B.
Recordation. Once issued, a certificate shall be recorded with the county clerk and recorder clearly identifying the real property by parcel number and/or a legal description of the property. Such certificate shall "run with the land" and its status shall not be affected by changes of tenancy, ownership, or management. However, such certificate and the underlying nonconforming use, structure, or sign shall be subject to all provisions of this chapter 79, including those relating to discontinuance and damage or destruction.
C.
Fees. An application fee shall be assessed for the processing and issuance of certificates of legal nonconforming status in accordance with the fee schedule adopted by the board.

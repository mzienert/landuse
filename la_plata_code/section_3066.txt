CHAPTER 66: PERMITS AND PROCEDURES
Overview
This chapter describes the common procedures for
county
review of all land development activity in the
unincorporated
areas of La Plata County and the specific procedures for the review of
land use permits
and other types of applications.
The provisions common to all permit and
development
review covered in this chapter include, among other things, pre-application procedures, submittal requirements, public notice, scope of
county
review, public meetings and appeals.
This chapter also includes the unique procedural review requirements or steps for most individual types of
land use permit
applications and the rules that will apply to an application once it is approved, such as the life of the
development
approval, expiration, and amendments.
The specific procedural steps for divisions of land are in chapter 67 and for
planned unit developments
in chapter 68.
Sec. 66-27 Variances
I.
Purpose and applicability.
Variances
are intended to alleviate exceptional practical difficulties or undue hardship arising from the strict application of the provisions of this
code
to a specific property.
Variances
address extraordinary, exceptional, or unique situations that were not caused by the
applicant’s
act or omission. Relief in the form of a
variance
, however, shall not have the effect of nullifying or impairing the intent and purpose of this
code
. A
variance
shall not be granted to allow a use not permitted, or a use expressly or by implication prohibited, under the terms of this
code
for the subject property. In addition, a
variance
shall not be granted to allow a greater
density
or intensity of
use
than allowed under the terms of this
code
for the subject property. The BOA shall hear
variances
from the specific terms of this
code
.
II.
Procedures.
Figure 66-27 below identifies the application steps that apply to the review of variances.

III.
Approval criteria.
A.
No
variance
allowed. The BOA shall not grant a
variance
to this
code
which allows:
1.
The
alteration
of any definition;
2.
A substantial modification to any
planned unit development
approved by the
board
;
3.
A decrease in the spacing requirements for a
marijuana facility
set forth in section 73-14.
B.
To allow a
variance
from the provisions of this
code
, the BOA shall find all the following:
1.
Hardship. Specific
development
standards, applied to the property in question, create an unnecessary, nonmonetary hardship for the
owner
, as distinguished from an inconvenience, financial hardship or self-imposed hardship.
2.
Special circumstances. Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land and facilities involved and are not applicable to other lands and facilities. The special conditions do not result from the actions of the
applicant
or a previous
owner
of the subject property.
3.
No special privilege. Granting the
variance
will not confer on the
applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this
code
to other lands or facilities.
4.
Comparison with other properties. The literal interpretation of the provisions of this
code
would deprive the
applicant
of rights commonly enjoyed by other similarly situated properties.
5.
Variance
minimum. The
variance
granted is the minimum
variance
possible to make reasonable use of the land or facilities.
6.
Conforms with goals and purpose. The granting of the
variance
will be in harmony with the general goals and purpose of this
code
.
7.
Not injurious to public. The
variance
will not be injurious to the neighborhood involved or detrimental to the public welfare, require extraordinary public expense, or create nuisances.
IV.
Effect of approval.
A.
General rule. Unless otherwise provided by the
decision-making body
, the
applicant
shall apply for any needed
land use permits
or
building permits
within six (6) months of the approval of the
variance
. The
variance
approval shall automatically lapse and be of no further force and effect if the
applicant
fails to obtain all necessary permits within a one (1) year period or if such permits are denied.
B.
Variances granted as part of
development
application. The approval period of any
variance
granted prior to or concurrently with the
county’s
approval of a
land use permit
or
development
application shall be the same as the approval period of the permit or
development
application and shall lapse with the approved permit or
development
application.
C.
Approved variances and redevelopment of the property. The
variance
approval shall automatically lapse and be of no further force and effect if redevelopment of the subject property makes compliance with this
code
possible without the previously approved
variance
.

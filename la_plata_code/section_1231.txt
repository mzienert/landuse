Sec. 78-25. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of
flood
protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights
may
be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside of
special flood hazard areas
or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall
not create liability on the part of the
county
, any officer or employee thereof or
FEMA
, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made thereunder.

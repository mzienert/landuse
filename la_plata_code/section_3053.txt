CHAPTER 66: PERMITS AND PROCEDURES
Overview
This chapter describes the common procedures for
county
review of all land development activity in the
unincorporated
areas of La Plata County and the specific procedures for the review of
land use permits
and other types of applications.
The provisions common to all permit and
development
review covered in this chapter include, among other things, pre-application procedures, submittal requirements, public notice, scope of
county
review, public meetings and appeals.
This chapter also includes the unique procedural review requirements or steps for most individual types of
land use permit
applications and the rules that will apply to an application once it is approved, such as the life of the
development
approval, expiration, and amendments.
The specific procedural steps for divisions of land are in chapter 67 and for
planned unit developments
in chapter 68.

A.
Recipients and required notification area for written notice. Surrounding landowners entitled to receive notices pursuant to Table 66-14 A shall include those property owners within five hundred (500) feet of the property line of the parcel subject to an application for a land use permit unless the director determines that an exception applies pursuant to paragraphs B and C below.

Exceptions.

For development located in the Animas Valley Land Use Plan Area, surrounding landowners shall include owners of property within one thousand (1,000) feet of the property line of the parcel subject to an application for a land use permit.
2.
For a linear or corridor facility including but not limited to a transmission line, pipeline or other linear facility, the notice shall be sent to all owners of record within a minimum of two hundred fifty (250) feet of the property which would be traversed by the route of the facility.
3.
For development that the director determines may uniquely impact neighboring properties, surrounding landowners shall also include all owners of property identified by the director that may be uniquely impacted.
C.
Changes to plats.  For proposed developments that make modifications or adjustments to existing plats or otherwise seek to change any aspect of a plat signed by the chair of the board, surrounding landowners shall also include all owners of property as shown on the plat.

Landowners shall be determined according to the listed owner(s) of record according to the county assessor’s records within five (5) business days of the date an application is submitted. Property within the notification area held in common ownership by a subdivision or subdivision homeowners’ association shall not require individual notice to all homeowners, but only notice to the association.
E.
Constructive notice.  Minor defects in notice shall not impair the notice or invalidate proceedings under the notice if a bona fide attempt has been made to comply with applicable notice requirements. Failure of a party to receive written notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action. In all cases, however, the requirements for the timing of the notice and for specifying the time, date, and place of a meeting and the location of the subject property shall be strictly construed.

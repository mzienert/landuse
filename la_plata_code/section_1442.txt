Sec. 90-1 Purposes and effective date
I.
Purpose.
The county’s shared objective with the State of Colorado for
oil and gas development
is to protect public health, safety and welfare, the environment and wildlife resources by establishing a regulatory framework for new and existing
OGL
s
and
OGFs
.  Oil and gas operations in the
unincorporated
areas of the county are activities that necessitate reasonable regulations to ensure all property owners, mineral and otherwise, have the right to enjoy their property and its benefits safely and peaceably. Specifically, these regulations are necessary to:
A.
Ensure oil and gas operation proposals are in general conformance with the goals, policies, actions and other provisions of the
comprehensive plan
(including the applicable
district plan
) as well as strict compliance with the goals, policies, standards and other provisions of this code.
B.
Ensure a comprehensive land use framework and transparent public process for the development and operation of OGLs and OGFs and establish criteria for the review and approval or denial of new applications.
C.
Avoid
adverse impacts
from oil and gas operations to public health, safety and welfare, the environment and wildlife resources and minimize and mitigate the extent and severity of those impacts that cannot be avoided. C.R.S. § 34-60-103(5.5).
D.
Provide for the orderly production of available mineral resources.
E.
Mitigate the on-site and off-site impacts of oil and gas operations through the application of best available technologies and other
BMPs
.
F.
Confirm the financial and insurance capacities of operators to ensure timely and effective construction, completion, production, removal and
reclamation
of OGLs, OGFs and related
infrastructure
in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, and conditions of approval.
II.
Coordinated development; balancing interests.
Under state law, the surface and mineral estates are separate and distinct interests in
real property
, and one may be severed from the other.  Subject to compliance with the provisions of this code and any other applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, owners of subsurface mineral interests have certain legal rights and privileges, including the right to use that part of the surface estate reasonably required to extract and develop subsurface mineral interests. Similarly, owners of the surface estate have certain legal rights and privileges, including the right to have the mineral estate developed in a reasonable manner and to have adverse impacts associated with the development of the mineral estate mitigated.
III.
Effective date; repeal.
A.
The effective date of this chapter is August 1, 2023.
B.
Repeal. Except to the extent necessary to enforce compliance with permits issued pursuant thereto or issued prior to the effective date, former chapter 90 of the La Plata County Land Use Code is hereby repealed on the effective date of this chapter. The repeal of former chapter 90 does not revive any other provisions, resolutions, ordinance, codes or other regulations repealed by this provision.

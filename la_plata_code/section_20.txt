I.
The
Board
shall convene on the first four Tuesdays of the month in regular meetings at the
county
seat of the county, unless otherwise scheduled. Under certain circumstances, regular meetings may be canceled, postponed or held in another location if the public interest may require. The Board may also convene on other days in special or emergency meetings, and in other locations within the county as, in the opinion of the Board, the public interest may require.
At regular, special or emergency meetings, the board may adopt policies, positions, resolutions, rules, regulations and ordinances and take formal action on matters and transact other county business, properly noticed pursuant to C.R.S. §§ 24-6-401 et seq., as amended.
Minutes at any regular, special or emergency meetings of the Board, at which the adoption of any proposed policy, position, resolution, rule, regulation, ordinance or formal action occurs or could occur shall be taken and promptly recorded, and such records shall be open to public inspection. Minutes of a meeting during which a duly authorized executive session is held shall reflect the general topic of the discussion at the executive session.  All regular, special and emergency meetings of the Board shall be open to the public.
II.
The Board reserves the right to set work/study sessions on any day by posting notice thereof in accordance with C.R.S. § 24-6-401 et seq. as amended. Work/study sessions shall be for the purpose of meeting with staff or the public to review matters of county business, receive reports, discuss items of current interest, day-to-day oversight of property and supervision of employees. No formal action shall be taken at a work/study session and no minutes shall be taken. All work sessions of the Board shall be open to the public.
III.
Pursuant to the provisions of C.R.S.§ 24-6-402, the Board may, upon affirmative vote of two members of the Board, and after public announcement of the purpose including the specific citation to the provision of the state statute authorizing an executive session, hold an executive session only at a regular or special meeting and for the sole purpose of considering the purchase, acquisition, lease, transfer or sale of any real, personal or other property interests; conferences with an attorney to receive legal advice on specific legal issues; matters required to be kept confidential by federal or state law, rules or regulations; specialized details of security arrangements or investigations; determining positions relative to matters that may be subject to negotiations, developing strategy for negotiations, and instructing negotiators; consideration of personnel matters except if the employee who is the subject of the session has requested an open meeting, or if the personnel matter involves more than one employee, and all of the employees have requested an open meeting provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to discussions concerning any member of the local public body, any elected official or the appointment of a person to fill the office of a member of the local public body or an elected official or to discussions of personnel policies that do not require the discussion of matters personal to particular employees; or consideration of any documents protected by the mandatory nondisclosure provisions of the Open Records Act. No adoption of any proposed policy, position, resolution, rule, regulation, ordinance or formal action shall occur at such executive session.  The motion to move to executive session must also include identification of the particular matter to be discussed in as much detail as possible without compromising the purpose for which the executive session is authorized.  All executive sessions shall be audio recorded provided, however, if, in the opinion of the county attorney, all or a portion of the discussion during the executive session constitutes a privileged attorney-client communication, then that portion of the executive session may not be recorded, at the discretion of the Board of County Commissioners.
IV.
Meetings noticed and scheduled as provided herein shall be held at the County Commissioners’ Board Room of the County Administration Building, 1101 East Second Ave., Durango, Colorado, unless otherwise noticed.
V.
All persons desiring to place an item on the agenda of the Board must submit, electronically, an agenda item with original documents for signatures, to the Clerk to the Board, 1101 E. Second Ave., Durango, Colorado, 81301, telephone (970) 382-6214, by 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday preceding the week of the meeting to which the request applies. It shall be the policy of the Board that, except in cases of emergency, items of business to be considered by the Board shall first be referred to the County Manager for appropriate departmental or staff review and recommendation.
VI.
Based on the intent of the legislature that local governments transition from posting physical notices of public meetings to posting notices on a website, social media account, or other official online local government presence to the greatest extent practicable, and pursuant to C.R.S. § 24-6-402(2)(c) and La Plata County Policy No. 1.B.5., when possible, the county will post meeting notices and agendas on a calendar on the county’s website or other website maintained by a particular board or commission at least twenty-four (24) hours (weekends excluded) in advance of the meeting, together with specific agenda information when possible. However, for public convenience, the office of the County Commissioners, located in the La Plata County Administration Building, 1101 East Second Avenue, Durango, Colorado, is also designated as a public place where notices of meetings of the Board shall be posted at least twenty-four (24) hours (weekends excluded) in advance of the meeting, together with specific agenda information when possible.
VII.
The County Manager is hereby directed to prepare a schedule showing all meeting times and items of business to be discussed or considered by the Board not less than twenty-four (24) hours (weekends excluded) in advance of any such meeting.  For example, when a Board meeting is to be held on a Monday at 10:00 a.m., such schedules shall be available to the press and public no later than 10:00 a.m. on the preceding Friday. This shall not be construed as precluding the posting of notices in compliance with paragraph 6 above. The County Manager shall provide notice of all meetings of the Board to the County Clerk and Recorder.  It shall be the policy of the Board to only discuss those matters listed and posted on the agenda twenty-four (24) hours (weekends excluded) in advance, except in an emergency or where the public interest otherwise requires.

The county manager is hereby directed to prepare a schedule showing all meeting times and items of business to be discussed or considered by the
board
not less than 24 hours (weekends excluded) in advance of any such meeting. For example, when a board meeting is to be held on a Monday at 10:00 a.m., such schedules
shall
be available to the press and public no later than 10:00 a.m. on the preceding Friday. This shall not be construed as precluding the posting of notices in compliance with section
2-59.
The county manager shall provide notice of all meetings of the board to the county clerk and recorder. It shall be the policy of the board to only discuss those matters listed and posted on the agenda 24 hours (weekends excluded) in advance, except in an
emergency
or where the public interest otherwise requires.

This Plan shall be known and referred to as the "La Plata County Weed Management and Enforcement Plan" and shall be effective throughout the unincorporated areas of La Plata County.
(Res. No. 2017-35, 10-24-17)
Effective on: 10/24/2017
Sec.58-102 Definitions
See Sec. 58-31 of the La Plata County Code.
Effective on: 10/24/2017
Sec.58-103 Introduction
The Colorado Noxious Weed Act (CRS 35-5.5-101, et. seq.) is designed to ensure that all the lands of the State of Colorado, whether in public or private ownership, be protected by and subject to the jurisdiction of a local government empowered to manage undesirable plants as designated by the State of Colorado and the local governing body. Certain undesirable plants constitute a present threat to the continued economic and environmental value of the lands of the State and if present in any area of the State, must be managed.
This Weed Management Plan represents a coordinated effort of the La Plata County Weed Office (Weed Office) and the La Plata County Undesirable Plant and Rodent Advisory Commission (Advisory Commission) to develop and oversee a comprehensive management plan for the control of noxious weeds in La Plata County. The Advisory Commission will review the plan at regular intervals as set forth in Section 58-35 of the La Plata County code.
This plan further recognizes that because the spread of noxious weeds can largely be attributed to the movement of seed and plant parts on motor vehicles, noxious weeds are becoming an increasing maintenance problem on highway right-of-ways in the state. As a result, local cooperative efforts have been undertaken to proceed with noxious weed management. The plan also recognizes that the changes brought about by extended drought due to climate changes will stress native plant life and weed infestation issues will continue to increase.
This plan is designed in accordance with the statutory provisions of the Colorado Noxious Weed Act. The provisions of this plan do not interpret, apply, or incorporate any provisions of the Colorado Pest Control District Act, codified at C.R.S. § 35-5-101, et seq.
(Res. No. 2017-35, 10-24-17)
Effective on: 10/24/2017
Sec.58-104 Goals of the La Plata County Weed Office and Weed Management Plan
The Goals of the La Plata County Weed Office and Weed Management Plan are to:
Work toward (1) eradication of List A species and (2) control of population of List B species through eradication or management, and (3) encourage voluntary treatments of list C species as such lists are designated by the state of Colorado and by the Board of County Commissioners. (see Attachment A for Lists)
Provide education and awareness to local governing bodies and affected landowners;
Provide continued research, inventory and mapping of weed spread or control efforts.
Treat and maintain weeds within County owned parcels, along County roads and in County rights of way;
Work collaboratively with county, regional and state efforts;
Provide information, technical assistance and assistance in the development and implementation of weed management plans to include but not be limited to:
Preventative measures
Control techniques
Revegetation
Rehabilitation techniques
Effective on: 10/24/2017
Sec. 58-105 Objectives of the La Plata County Weed Office
Sec. 58-105.1 Eradication and Control
Continually update La Plata County list A and B weeds list accordingly with the state noxious weed lists. A local governing body may adopt eradication, containment, or suppression standards that are more stringent than the standards adopted by the (state) commissioner (35-5.5-108). Certain state list B weeds that are rare in the County may be elevated to County List A status in order to better eradicate before widespread infestation occurs.
Focus on identifying and locating County List A noxious weeds and pursue eradication efforts with enforcement actions if necessary (Sec. 58-58 through 58-74)
Continually monitor County List B populations with the goal of containment if possible and reduction over time.
When deemed necessary, and according the Colorado Noxious Weed Act and La Plata County Code, enforcement will be utilized to protect neighboring parcels and decrease the spread of List A or List B weeds. See sections 58-58 through 58-74 of the La Plata County Code.
Sec. 58-105.2 Education and Awareness.
Education should be the first step in weed management and implementation plans.
Educate the public on the state mandated weed law (the Colorado Noxious Weed Act) and the state’s mandate that La Plata County act to manage, and sometimes to eradicate, certain noxious weeds so designated by the Department.
Educate and make the public aware of the State of Colorado A, B and C weed species, and additional weeds designated for management by the Board of County Commissioners (BoCC).
The weed office shall act as a reference or source of reliable up to date weed management techniques, including detailed proper use of herbicide products in an correct, effective, safe and environmentally sound method.
Provide educational materials, both in print and on-line, workshops, lectures, site visits, and personal consultation weed management and up to date technical information.
Colorado State University Cooperative Extension (sometimes hereinafter referred to as “CSU Extension”) will partner with the weed office and the La Plata County Advisory Commission in communicating to the public broad, efficient, and cost effective weed management programs.
Raise public awareness that noxious weeds disrupt intended land use and degrade the environment;
Raise public awareness that the county has limited funds with which to control noxious weeds (subject to limited availability);
Assist landowners and private enterprise in preparing integrated weed management plans;
Produce periodic press releases on weed management;
Advise individual producers and landowners on developing weed management plans (WMP);
Provide pesticide certification workshops;
Develop and implement test plots demonstrating effective weed management techniques and recommendations.
Sec. 58-105.3 Research, Inventory and Mapping
Continue mapping of noxious weeds countywide and compiling of information in cooperation with other agencies, specifically working with the Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA) on updating required weed species on an annual basis.
Noxious weed surveys and maps shall be provided for any land owners within the County who request them.
A map showing the parcel and noxious weed infestations will be provided when sending out notice letters.
Maintain up to date GIS inventory of noxious weeds throughout the county using the most current mapping technology and methods. County roads should be mapped as well to monitor changes in infestations. Mapping data will be available for the public upon request.
Maintain a reference library and internet links of related materials for management of designated and noxious weeds. Material will be available in both paper form and on the weed office website.
Sec. 58-105.4  Treat and maintain weeds within County owned parcels, along County roads and in County rights of way.
Supervise the application of weed control on county property and rights-of-way within the county.
Sec. 58-105.5 Work collaboratively with County, regional and state efforts.
La Plata County shall encourage participation in Cooperative Weed Management Areas otherwise known as CWMA’s. The purpose of a CWMA is to unite people and resources in specific geographical areas to manage conditions and problematic noxious weeds. The formation of CWMA’s additionally provides an organized structure for which funds and grants can be obtained for the purpose of weed management. CWMA’s can benefit homeowners associations, specific watersheds which encompass areas like the Upper Pine Vallecito Lake or larger areas such as the 5.5 million acre San Juan Mountains Cooperative Weed Management Area (SJMCWMA).
Sec. 58-105.6 Provide Technical Assistance
The La Plata County Weed Office Manager and staff shall provide personal consultations on weed management and up to date technical information and assistance. They will offer consultation to individuals, groups, governing bodies and organizations in person in the office or in the field on site as necessary.
(Res. No. 2017-35, 10/24/17)
Effective on: 10/24/2017
Sec. 58-106 Integrated Weed Management Plans
C.R.S. § 35-5.5-104 requires all persons to use integrated methods (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "IM") to manage noxious weeds if the weeds are likely to be materially damaging to the land of neighboring landowners.  It is the intent of the BoCC to implement a coordinated program of integrated management. The purpose of integrated management is to achieve healthy and productive natural and agricultural ecosystems through a balanced program. This program will include, but not be limited to, education, prevention measures, good stewardship and control methods.
Integrated management is a strategy using a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to plant management. By viewing a problem in its entirety, one is better able to design a management plan that is safe, cost effective and gets results, without unreasonable damage to natural controls and the environment. An IM approach to weed management includes choosing from a variety of available weed control strategies and predicting their long term effects.
The major weed control tactics to be considered in an IM program are:
Education should be considered the number one priority (e.g., plant identification, life cycles, mapping infestations).
Prevention (e.g., eliminate undesirable plant seed dispersal, irrigation management, soil fertility, range management and minimizing disturbances to the landscape).
Mechanical and physical (e.g., cutting, mowing, burning, cultivation and cross fencing).
Cultural (e.g., crop rotation, rehabilitation by the establishment of competitive crops, grasses and mulching).
Biological (e.g., grazing, predators, parasites and pathogens).
Chemical (e.g., weed oils, nonselective and selective herbicides, and plant growth regulators).
While these tactics can be used singularly, they are usually most effective when used in combination. Once it is determined why the weeds are occurring in the first place, strategies can be developed not only to reduce existing weed populations and change the size of infestations, but also to prevent future weed problems.
The A, B and C Weed Lists annexed hereto and made a part hereof as Attachment A shall be utilized in the administration of the Management Plan pursuant to Chapter 58 of the La Plata County Code.
(Res. No. 2017-35, 10-24-17)
Effective on: 10/24/2017
Sec. 58-107 Priority Management Areas
Infestations adjacent to property lines, easements, rights-of-way, ditches, canals, streams, rivers, trails, wildlife migration routes and private and public roadways: Buffering is suggested for each growing season and applied to the entire perimeter of the infestation at a minimum of fifty feet wide at the proper timing in order to prevent seed formation and root spread. Annual stepped in buffering, in addition to maintaining previous buffers, and reduction management shall be recommended.
(Res. No. 2017-35, 10-24-17)
Effective on: 10/24/2017
Sec. 58-108 Methods of Control
The La Plata County Weed Manager and staff will provide information and technical assistance and consultation and assistance implementing weed management techniques and plans to include but not be limited to:
preventative measures
control techniques
revegetation
rehabilitation techniques
Sec. 58-108.1 Prevention:
The first priority is to prevent the introduction of any noxious weed to any area not previously infested.
Many of the most common weed problems occur in response to disturbed soils. Disturbances can result from a number of conditions including overgrazed pastures, overused turf, clear cut woodlands, pipeline construction and energy/gravel development, improperly maintained road edges, and land development. Land management practices that minimize soil disturbance are invaluable in prevention and control of undesirable plant species.
Educate the public how viable seeds or propagating plant parts may spread by mechanical means. All equipment should be cleaned when leaving all infested areas to prevent contaminating rights-of-way and the next area entered. Practical solutions to accomplish this will be explored with industry professionals and findings will be published in written form and placed on the internet.
Gravel pits will be inspected once a year by the county weed manager to insure that these areas are not vectors for large scale noxious weed dispersal.
It is recommended that noxious weed-free certified seed is used in all applications. Feed containing viable noxious weed seeds should not be purchased, transported, or used: Since designated weeds will set seed prior to normal harvest dates, crops need to be treated if they are to be moved from the infested area.
Also to be considered is whether once seed has reached maturity, it can remain viable for years. During this time, it can re-infest the same area long after the weed problem appears to have been solved, or it can be transported to other areas. This can occur naturally by wind and water or mechanically by movement of vehicles or equipment. Seeds are also transported great distances by domestic animals and wildlife.
Small, isolated patches of weeds should be prioritized and eliminated as soon as possible to prevent a larger, more expensive problem later in the future.
Sec. 108.2 Mechanical control.
Mechanical control includes cultivation, mowing, hand pulling, tilling and burning. All of these measures,
when used and timed correctly
, can be of great help when used in conjunction with another type of control. When used alone on perennial plants, they rarely have a positive long-range effect due to the extensive underground root system. It may, in fact, make the problem worse through spreading seed or plant parts and by eliminating the desirable competitive species on site. These measures are much more effective with annuals and biennial plants if done before seeding occurs.
Sec. 58-108.3 Cultural control:
Cultural management of weeds includes methodologies or management practices that favor the growth of desirable plants over noxious weeds, including maintaining an optimum fertility and plant moisture status in an area, planting at optimum density and spatial arrangement in an area, and planting species most suited to an area. (CRS § 35-5.5 103 (9)(c)).
Other examples of increasing field conditions such that weeds are less likely to become established and/or increase in number are crop rotation, avoiding overgrazing of pastures or rangeland, use of beneficial animal or insects and using cover crops or other well-adapted competitive forage species.
Sec. 58-108.4 Biological control.
Biological control is the control of undesirable plants through the use of living organisms. The organism may be an insect, plant, pathogen or livestock, such as sheep, goats or cattle.
Recent programs have shown that livestock can be valuable in controlling many weed species, if managed correctly. This is especially true in instances of large infestations of annual and biennial weeds and in environmentally sensitive areas. The use of grazing on perineal species is largely ineffective. Animals must be contained onto infested areas for duration that is long enough to eliminate noxious weeds. When moving livestock from such an infested area for biological control, care should be taken to prevent transportation of seeds to a clean area. If possible, when applicable, livestock should be quarantined for five days to allow all seed to pass through the digestive track. Seed may also need to be removed from the animals' hair, wool and hooves.
Several species of insects are available for noxious weed management. They may be purchased by individuals to be used as part of an integrated plan. Evidence shows that there is limited success with this type of control. Use of insects is thought to be more of a long term suppression technique rather than short term eradication. For more information contact: the Colorado Department of Agriculture Insectary in Palisade, Colorado.
New research and development in bacteria, fungus and pathogens have shown promising results in decreasing infestations overtime. The county will continue to keep up to date in these techniques and educate the public on their uses and effectiveness. The use of test plots can further increase the knowledge and capacity of these measures to gain local insight that can be used for the county’s own weed treatment program.
Sec. 108.5 Chemical control.
The weed office shall act as a reference or source of reliable up to date of weed management techniques, including detailed proper use of herbicide products in an correct, effective, safe and environmentally sound method.
All chemical application must be done according to the label for each individual product.
The choice of chemicals and application rates that are used should be according to the product label. The applicator of herbicide must realize the importance of using the right product, at the right time to make treatment most effective. Calibration of spraying equipment is the most accurate way of determining the right rate of herbicide. Products that are volatile are not recommended. So herbicide can kill trees or lead to manure that can kill garden plants. Consultation with a county employee with a “Qualified Supervisor” license is the best resource for up to date, reliable herbicide information.
When herbicides are used at a diluted rate on plants, they can survive and reproduce. The new generations are now resistant to that chemical formulation and will become much harder to kill in the future. The County weed office must follow and recommend techniques that prevent herbicide resistance. This can be implemented by calibrating sprayers and requiring treatments that kill all weeds that are spraying. The public must be informed of the risks and dangers of resistance as well.
While chemicals are a powerful tool, it must be realized that they are just a tool and must be used only as a part of an integrated management plan.
The focus of this plan is excerpted from the Colorado Weed Management Act, C.R.S. § 35-5.5-101 et seq..

Sec.  58-109 Other
109.1 Containment and Buffering Strategies
Management and Buffering Strategies: All landowners and land managers with county listed weed species will be required to implement the following management strategies:
Infestations of one acre or less:
Isolated small populations: Intensive best management practices applied with eradication goals in mind. Prevent seed formation and root spread on an annual basis.
Satellite populations proximate to larger populations: Intensive best management practices applied with eradication, containment, and reduction goals in mind. Prevent seed formation and root spread on an annual basis.
Larger populations of more than one acre:
Using effective, best management practices, apply containment and perimeter buffering management practices at a minimum of fifty feet wide each growing season. Prevent seed formation and root spread on an annual basis.
Continue weed management in the year-one fifty-foot buffer zone. Perimeter buffering management practices shall be stepped inward toward the center of the infestation at a minimum of fifty feet wide each season thereafter until the desired goals of the weed management plan have been met.
109.2 Treating in or around ditch areas
Colorado requires a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit through the Clean Water Act for applications in or near water. Use of products shall comply with State and Federal law and product labels.
The State of Colorado NPDES Advisory Committee has recommended a clarification in the definition of ditches. Ditches are now divided into wet ditches and dry ditches in Colorado.
Dry Ditch Treatments:
La Plata County Contractors will treat only dry ditches; therefore a NPDES Permit will not be required.
Wet Ditch Treatments:
If it is further determined that certain wet ditches need to be treated for target weeds, a special work order will be issued before any treatments occur. Exact wet treatment footage will be noted and submitted with the treatment data. Only EPA registered aquatic labeled products will be applied in wet ditches. Treatment thresholds of twenty (20) linear miles shall not be exceeded annually, therefore eliminating the requirement for a NPDES permit.

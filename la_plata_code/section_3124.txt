Chapter 74: Road and Bridge Standards and Permits
Sec. 74-9 Permitting within county right-of-way and road improvement agreements.
The public works department issues permits that regulate activities in the right-of-way to ensure that the integrity of the right-of-way system is maintained and to protect the health, safety and welfare of the traveling public and citizens of the county. This includes permits for third parties to perform work in the county right-of-way, driveway access, or utility construction. Chapter 42 addresses special event permits.

.
A.
Permit required. No person shall construct or improve any road, drainage, utility or other infrastructure or facilities within a county right-of-way without first obtaining a permit from the public works department. A permit shall pertain only to the work authorized and the permittee shall not enter onto private property or alter or disturb any private facilities or installations within the right-of-way.
B.
Term of permit. County right-of-way permits are valid for one (1) year but may be renewed for one additional one (1) year period, provided the renewal is obtained prior to the date of expiration.

The bond shall ensure that the permittee complies with all county standards and specifications and recovery by the county of any expenses incurred within three-hundred and sixty-five (365) days following the expiration of the permit due to the permittee’s failure to comply with the provisions of this code or due to the permittee otherwise having caused expenses to the county as a result of the work performed.
2.
Exceptions. At the discretion of the public works director, municipalities, quasi-municipal agencies, ditch companies, electric, gas and communications utilities may provide a letter of responsibility in lieu of posting the required bond. The letter of responsibility, which shall be filed with the public works department, shall be in a form acceptable to the public works director.
D.
Specifications.
1.
Return to prior condition. An applicant receiving a county road right-of-way permit shall ensure, to the satisfaction of the public works director, that the county road is returned to a condition equal to or better than the original condition, within the limits of careful, diligent workmanship, good planning and quality materials. Such work shall be accomplished in the least possible time and with the least disturbance to the normal functioning of the county road or other property.
2.
Road cuts. Road cuts shall not be allowed unless the public works director determines that subsurface conditions preclude boring.

All traffic control conducted as part of an emergency repair shall follow the standards specified in the MUTCD.

The applicant shall notify the public works director of any subsequent scheduling changes. The public works director shall have the authority but not the obligation to inspect the work throughout the construction period to verify compliance with all applicable county standards and regulations. The inspection performed will be at the discretion of the public works director and will include, but not be limited to, densities, moisture content, resurfacing and cleanup activities. In instances where there is a question as to the acceptability of the materials to be used for backfilling, an advance request for an inspection in these instances shall be made. Inspection requests for road construction during snowy or freezing weather shall be postponed until acceptable weather conditions prevail.
H.

Once a stop work order is issued, the person, municipality or utility shall, except for emergency repair work, discontinue all work within the county road right-of-way until such time as the required repair has been satisfactorily completed, and no further permits will be issued until the repair has been made or the county reimbursed for its expenses.

The minimum charge shall be an administrative charge listed in appendix A of this code, plus reasonable costs for labor, materials and equipment on a portal to portal basis.
K.
Priority of utilities
1.
.Due to the limited capacity of county owned right-of-way, the board has prioritized public utilities over private utilities when using county rights-of-way for parallel installation. The following are exempted from the general priority of this paragraph K:
a.
Crossings by a private utility, as opposed to requests for parallel installation;
b.
Maintenance, repair or replacement of pre-existing pipelines.
2.
Procedure and evaluation.
a.
In determining whether a permit shall be issued to a private utility, the public works director shall evaluate the maximum capacity of the right-of-way to accommodate the present and expected installation and operation of lines and facilities intended to distribute utilities and telecommunications products to end-users of such products and to also accommodate such other pipelines, wires, cable and any other facilities that any other private or public entity may install and operate in such right-of-way. Consideration shall also be given to future road improvement projects.
b.
If the public works director determines approving the permit will adversely affect future road improvement projects or would occupy such capacity in the right-of-way that it would likely prevent the expected reasonable and necessary future expansion of utility distribution lines and facilities in the right-of-way, the public works director may deny the permit application.
c.
A permit may be approved by the public works director where the applicant demonstrates there is no practical alternative route or that the alternative route(s) would not be in the best interest of the public, including without limitation consideration of environmental degradation, destruction of wetlands or adverse impacts to cultural resources.
II.
Road improvement agreements.
Significant work, as determined by the public works director, performed in a county road right-of-way, as part of a land use permit or otherwise, shall require a road improvement agreement between the county and the party performing the improvements. The board has approved a standardized road improvement agreement. The public works director, with the assistance of the county attorney, may negotiate amendments to the standardized road improvement agreement; however, any amended road improvement agreement must be presented to the board for approval.
III.
Cattle guards permits.
A.
Permit required. No person shall install, construct or remove a cattle guard in a county right-of-way without first obtaining a permit from the public works department.
B.
Procedure and evaluation.
1.
Application and inspection. The public works director shall review all applications for installation of a cattle guard on a county road, inspect the site, and may, if necessary, request further relevant information from the applicant. Design of the cattle guard shall be based on CDOT’s specifications for cattle guards. The public works director may deny the application if the installation of the cattle guard would be detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of the public, or would adversely affect the flow of traffic or maintenance of the county road.
2.
Construction. Construction of the cattle guard shall conform to the plans submitted to and approved by the public works director. All construction must comply with the terms and conditions of the revocable license to perform work in the county right-of-way.

c.

The person requesting removal shall provide notice of the proposed action in writing to all parties benefiting from the cattle guard. Such notice shall be sent by certified U.S. mail and shall state that comments may be provided to the public works director within fifteen (15) days of receipt. If the cattle guard no longer serves a public benefit, as determined in the sole discretion of the public works director, the public works director may grant removal. If the public works director authorizes the removal, the cattle guard shall be removed at the requesting party’s expense.
b.
A permit to construct a cattle guard shall not create a vested property right, and the county, in the public works director's sole discretion, may remove a cattle guard in a county road after mailing written notice of removal to the parties benefitting from the cattle guard. Such notice shall be mailed at least fifteen (15) days prior to commencement of the removal. If such cattle guard is removed by the county, the removal shall be at the county's expense.

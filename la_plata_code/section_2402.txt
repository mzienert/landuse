18-35
(110) of this Code. Initial inspections shall be at the request of the
permittee
but, if the building official determines any follow-up or additional inspections are necessary, such follow-up or additional inspections may be conducted without notice to the permittee.
2. Non-permitted Premises.
Where a building or structure is not subject to an active building permit, but the building official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in the building or structure, or upon its premises, a condition which is contrary to or in
violation
of this Code and which makes the building, structure, or premises unsafe, dangerous, or hazardous, the building official is authorized to enter the building, structure, or premises at reasonable times to inspect or otherwise perform the duties imposed by this Code, provided that if such building, structure, or premises is occupied, credentials shall be presented to the occupant(s) and entry requested. If such building, structure, or premises is unoccupied, the building official shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the
owner
or other person having charge or
control
of the building, structure, or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, or if the owner or person in charge of an unoccupied structure does not respond to the building official’s reasonable efforts to locate him or her, then the building official and his or her agents or employees may make recourse to any remedy provided by local, state, or federal law or regulation to secure entry to the building, structure, or premises.

104.8 Nonliability. The adoption of this Code shall not create any duty to any person, firm, corporation, or other entity with regard to enforcement or non-enforcement of this Code.  No person, firm, corporation, or other entity shall have any private right of action, claim, or civil liability remedy against La Plata County, the building official, the Building Department, or any officers, employees, or agents of La Plata County for any damages arising out of or in any way connected with the adoption, enforcement, or non-enforcement of this Code.  Nothing in this Code shall be construed to create any liability, or to waive any of the immunities, limitations on liability, or other provisions of the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act, C.R.S. § 24-10-101
et seq.
, or to waive any immunities or limitations on liability otherwise available to La Plata County, and its commissions,

equipment
, and design. Materials, equipment, and devices approved by the building official shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval, the manufacturer’s instructions, and the safety requirements of this Code. The provisions of this Code are not intended to prevent the installation of any material or to prohibit any design or method of construction not specifically prescribed by this Code, provided any such alternative has been approved by the building official.  An alternative material, design or method of construction for a specific permit may be approved on a case by case basis where the building official finds that the proposed design or material is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the applicable provisions of this Code. Used materials, equipment, and devices may be used upon approval of the building official when sufficient documentation or information — as determined by the building official in the exercise of his or her discretion — is provided to demonstrate that their
use
will comply with the safety requirements of this Code.
104.10 Modifications. Whenever the building official determines, in the exercise of his or her discretion, that circumstances specific to a building, structure, or premises render compliance with and/or enforcement of any provision of this Code
impracticable
, the building official shall have the authority to consider and
grant
an application for modification of this Code’s provisions as to an individual building or structure. Before granting any such application for modification, the building official shall determine that the specific circumstances cited in the application render code compliance and/or enforcement impracticable, and that the modification requested will not materially lessen or weaken this Code’s requirements concerning health, accessibility, life and fire safety, or structural requirements. The details granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the files of the Building Department pursuant to section 104.7.
104.11. Tests. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the provisions of this Code or any other applicable law, or evidence that any material, equipment, design, or other construction method does not conform to the requirements of this Code or any other applicable law, or to substantiate claims for alternative materials or methods, the building official shall have the authority, at the expense of the applicant, to require expert opinions or tests as evidence of compliance.
Standards
and methods for any required expert opinions or tests shall be as specified in this Code or as required by the building official in the exercise of his or her discretion.  Where applicable, expert opinions or tests shall be procured from an approved agency and/or design professional.

9. Identification of any
geologic hazards
associated with the construction site and any special engineering or other measures necessary to
mitigate
those geologic hazards. Such identification may trigger additional submittal or review requirements including those set forth below in subsections (a) through (c) and at section
18-35
(107.2).
10. Expansive soils. When it is found that a building site is located in an area of the County where the soils are classified as being highly expansive, or technical evidence and soil characteristics indicate highly expansive soils, the foundation system for all residential structures must be designed by a
professional engineer
, licensed by the State of Colorado.  The design of the foundation system will address the expansion or
adverse
soil conditions at the site. The classification of soils will be based on the “soil survey of La Plata County area, Colorado” provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture – Soil Conservation 1981-82, and the maps on the La Plata County GIS Mapping System.
11. Geologic hazards. When the building site is located in an area subject to geologic hazards, the building official may require an engineering geologist or other
engineer
working within their field of expertise to submit specific recommendations for site development to address site drainage and defensive techniques that will limit
impacts
of the geologic hazards.  This requirement applies only to residential and
commercial
buildings and structures.

project
will comply with this Code.
105.4 Time limitation of application. A permit application on which no permit has issued shall be deemed to have been
abandoned
180 days after the date of the application’s filing, unless such application has been pursued in
good faith
. The building official is authorized, in the exercise of his or her discretion, to grant one extension of time, not exceeding 180 days, to allow the applicant to pursue his or her application.  The extension shall be requested in writing with a demonstration that circumstances beyond the applicant’s control previously have prevented the applicant from pursuing the application in good faith. If no extension is granted, no further processing of an abandoned application shall occur, and the application shall be considered automatically withdrawn.  Any plans submitted with the application shall be either returned to the applicant or destroyed by the building official. Any re-submittal of the application thereafter by the applicant will be treated as a new application for purposes of review, scheduling, and payment of application fees.
105.5 Action on application. The building official shall examine or cause to be examined applications for permits and amendments thereto within a reasonable time after filing. If the application or any of its attachments do not conform to the requirements of this Code, pertinent laws, or County regulations, the building official shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the building official is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this Code, and any laws and ordinances applicable thereto, the building official shall issue a permit as soon as practicable. When the building official issues a permit, all construction documents shall be stamped “approved.” Field inspections may warrant changes or corrections to meet Code requirements.
105.6 Validity of permit. The issuance or granting of a permit shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any
violation
of any provision of this Code or of any other applicable law or regulation. Any language in an issued permit contrary to or in conflict with the provisions of this Code shall be invalid. The issuance of a permit based on construction documents and other data shall not prevent the building official from later requiring the correction of errors in the construction documents and other data. The building official may prohibit occupancy or use of a building or structure determined to be in violation of this Code or of any other applicable law or regulation.
105.7 Lapsed or Abandoned Permits.
105.7.1 Lapse. Every permit issued shall lapse and be of no further force or effect unless the work on the site is commenced within 12 months after the permit’s issuance.  If the permit has lapsed, the applicant must reapply for and be granted a renewal (pursuant to subsection 105.8 below) or a new permit to proceed with the project.  Any activity occurring under a lapsed permit may be subject to an investigation fee as provided in section
18-35
(109.3) of this Code.
105.7.2
Abandonment
. If the work authorized on the site by a permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 12 months after the date on which work was commenced, the permit will be considered abandoned and be of no further force and effect.  If the permit is abandoned, the applicant must reapply for and be granted a renewal (pursuant to subsection 105.8 below) or a new permit to proceed with the project.  Any activity occurring under an abandoned permit may be subject to an investigation fee as provided in section
18-35
(109.3) of this Code.
105.8 Permit renewal. A lapsed or abandoned permit may be renewed upon payment of a renewal permit fee of up to 25% of the original permit fee.  A permit may be renewed only if no changes have been made to the construction documents submitted with the original permit application. A renewed permit shall have the same permit number as the original permit. Permit renewal will be based upon the version of this Code, and any other applicable laws and regulations, in effect at the time of the original permit’s issuance. Renewal permits may lapse or become abandoned in the same manner as the original permit, pursuant to section
18-35
(105.7). Any changes to the original approved plans will be subject to additional fees and requirements based on valuation and the current fee schedule.
105.9 Suspension or revocation. The building official may suspend or revoke a permit when he or she determines that:
1. There is a material departure from the approved plans, specifications, or conditions of the permit; or
2. There is a violation of any provision of this Code; or
3. The permit was obtained based on the submittal of incorrect, inaccurate, or incomplete information; or
4. The permit was issued in error.
No suspension or revocation shall occur before the building official provides reasonable notice to the
permittee
that any of the conditions listed above in this section exist. Upon receiving such notice, the permittee shall be entitled to a
hearing
before the building official and a reasonable opportunity to correct the condition(s).
If the building official suspends the permittee’s permit following such notice, hearing, and opportunity to correct the condition(s), then no further work, construction, or other activity shall proceed until a final determination is made. The building official shall place a red tag indicating that the building permit is suspended on every structure subject to that suspended permit.  A permit’s suspension shall remain in effect and the red tag shall remain in place until the building official determines that the condition(s) underlying the suspension has been remedied.

Board of County Commissioners
.  All applicable fees shall be submitted with each application.  All fees are cumulative, non-refundable, and will not be prorated if an application is withdrawn, or is
abandoned
.
Permit fees are derived from a combination of processes. Fees can be charged based on a flat fee, flat fee per square foot, or based on valuation of construction
costs
. The determination of value or valuation under any of the provisions of this
Code
shall be made by the
building official
with reference to valuation information provided by the International Code Council (“ICC”)’s  building valuation data. The value to be used in computing the
building permit
and fees shall be the total value of all construction work (such as foundation work, structural and non-structural building components, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, insulation, and gas and associated plumbing
equipment

Required Inspections
110.1 General.
Construction
or work for which a
permit
is required shall be subject to inspection by the
building official
, and such construction or work shall remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved. It shall be the duty of the
owner
,
contractor
, or subcontractor to confirm that the
building
or
structure
has a valid permit and to notify the Building
Department
when work is ready for inspection. It shall be the duty of the owner, contractor, or subcontractor requesting any inspections required by this
Code
to provide legal and adequate
access
and means for inspection of such work. The address of the building
site
must be posted in a conspicuous place readily visible from the
public
road
.
Approval following inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a subsequently discovered
violation
of any provision of this Code, or any other provision of the La Plata
County
Code. Inspections presumed to authorize a violation of this Code or to render invalid any provision of this Code or the La Plata County Code shall not be valid. Neither the building official nor the County shall be liable for any expense incurred in the removal or replacement of any material required to allow inspection. Requests for inspection shall be made 24 hours in advance of the work being ready for inspection. Inspections will be provided on a first come, first served basis. Due to workload and schedules of department personnel, the owner, contractor, or subcontractor may not request a specific date or time for conduction of the inspection.
If, due to excessive workload and staffing limitations, the building official is unable to perform a requested inspection within a reasonable time, special inspection reports may be accepted to address the required inspections noted herein.  When approved in advance by the building official, such special inspection reports may be prepared by a qualified architect or
engineer
, qualified inspector, or other inspection agency provided such agency satisfies the building official’s requirements as to qualifications and reliability.
110.2 Required inspections. The building official, upon request as provided in section 110.1, shall perform any applicable inspection described below in sections 110.3.1 through 110.3.10.

soil conditions exist on the site, footings shall be constructed in accordance with soils and geo-technical reports and/or engineered
plans
designed to address and/or
mitigate
the adverse soil conditions.
110.2.1.1 Drilled pier inspections. Drilled pier inspections will be made after piers have been drilled, and reinforcing, if any, is in place, but prior to the placing of concrete in piers. In the event pier drilling and placement of concrete occurs in a continuous fashion, making a single inspection impractical, the engineer of record or his authorized representative shall inspect drilling, reinforcement and placement of concrete as required.
110.2.1.2 Foundation wall inspections. Foundation wall inspections will be made after the footings or piers have been poured. The foundation walls shall be inspected when all forms are constructed, and reinforcing steel and void material is in place. For foundations in
flood
hazard
zones, verification of
base flood elevations
in relation to foundation/future finished floor will be required. Where
platted building envelopes
exist, upon completion of the footing system and exterior supports for decks, the land surveyor will be required to verify the foundation system is positioned inside the
building envelope
.
110.2.2 Concrete slab or under-floor inspection. Concrete slab and under-floor inspections shall be made after in-slab or under-floor reinforcing steel and anchoring devices, building service
equipment
, conduit, DWV plumbing, piping
accessories

Section 111 Occupancy Approvals
111.1
Use
and occupancy. No
building
or
structure
, or portion thereof, requiring a
permit
in accordance with section
18-35
(105) of this
Code
, shall be used or occupied, and no change in the existing occupancy classification of such building or structure, or portion thereof, shall be made, until the
building official
has issued an appropriate certificate authorizing the legal occupancy of the building  or structure.
111.1.1
New construction
Certificate of Occupancy.  Following issuance of a
building permit
, compliance with all required inspections, compliance with the International
Fire Code
as adopted and amended by Chapter 34 of the La Plata
County
Code, and completion of the final inspection described above in section
18-35
(110.2.8), the building official may issue a certificate of occupancy. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy will verify that
construction
work has been completed in accordance with permitted
plans
and necessary inspections were completed. The certificate will serve as written notification from the building official to the property
owner
that the work covered under the permit is complete and the permit is closed.
EXCEPTION: Single occupancies of Group U used solely for
agriculture
buildings, barns, carports, garages,
livestock
shelters, private garages, sheds, or stables are exempt from the certificate of occupancy requirements.  Group U occupancies with
residential
uses must receive a certificate of occupancy.
111.1.2 Certificate of Temporary Occupancy. The building official is authorized, at his or her discretion, to issue a certificate of temporary occupancy before the completion of the entire work covered by the permit, provided that the building official determines that the completed portions can be occupied safely. The certificate of temporary occupancy shall expire on a date certain, as stated on the certificate.
The building official may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for residential (R-3) occupancies when the structure is substantially completed, but not completed to a point that a final inspection can be performed. The
permittee
must have obtained final approvals for the
sewage
disposal system, installation of safety features, fire separations between living areas and attached garages, and either the completion of the plumbing system within the home or the isolation of fixtures that are not yet installed before a certificate of temporary occupancy may issue.
The failure to obtain a certificate of occupancy before the expiration of the certificate of temporary occupancy shall be a
violation
of this Code. The building official shall notify the permittee of such violation in writing and the notice of violation shall be retained in the records of the Building
Department
. The building official, at his or her discretion, may use all legal enforcement remedies to halt the use and occupancy of the building or structure.
111.1.3 Certificate of Limited Compliance. The building official may issue a permittee a certificate of limited compliance in lieu of a certificate of occupancy when any of the following circumstances exist, but the building official nevertheless determines that occupancy of the building or structure does not pose a risk to health or safety:
1. Failure to complete required inspections. A permittee, or any of the permittee's
agents
, fails to complete any inspection required by section
18-35
(110). The certificate of limited compliance shall list those inspections which must be completed to obtain a certificate of occupancy.
2. Construction without a building permit. A
project
is constructed without issuance of a building permit, such that any inspection required by section
18-35
(110) cannot be completed. The certificate of limited compliance shall list those inspections which must be completed to obtain a certificate of occupancy, as well as any other instances in which full compliance with this Code was not achieved.
3. Construction not in accordance with approved plans. A permitted project is not completed according to the plans which the Building Department has approved pursuant to section
18-35
(106). A project will be considered to be not in accordance with approved plans in circumstances including, but not limited to, where the approved plans provide that a portion of the project will remain unfinished, but the permittee finishes that portion; or where the approved plans provide that a portion of the project will be finished, but that portion remains unfinished. The certificate of limited compliance shall identify those portions of the project not completed in accordance with the approved plans.
Issuance of a certificate of limited compliance will close the building permit. To obtain a certificate of occupancy, the permittee, the permittee's agents, or the permittee's successors in interest must apply for and obtain a new building permit authorizing the completion or correction of all items which the certificate of limited compliance identifies as outstanding or non-compliant.
111.1.4 Remodel,
additions
, or relocated structures certificate. Remodels or additions to buildings, and relocated buildings, shall receive a certificate of occupancy for the work completed after plans have been submitted, a permit issued, and all required inspections are completed.  The certificate shall state that it does not certify that the entire building meets all the requirements of the Code for new buildings.
111.1.5 Certificate issued – documentation and information. Any certificate issued by the building official for occupancy of a structure shall contain the following information:
1.
Building permit number; and

R301.2.3 Snow loads. Section R301.2.3 of the 2015 International Residential Code is deleted and replaced with the following:
The design of roof systems and assemblies shall be designed using the snow load information contained in Table R301.2.3.  The information represented in Table R301.2.3 provides pounds per square foot snow load for areas and elevations in La Plata County.    This information can also be found by individual
parcel
of land on the La Plata County GIS maps.   Properties having more than one snow load shall
use
the higher load in the structural calculations.  Pursuant to section
18-35
(107.2(9)),
buildings
in regions with live loads of  80 pounds per square foot or more shall, at the discretion of the
building official
be required to be designed by a design professional.
In the design of buildings and
structures
,
consideration
shall be given to the following:
1.
Unbalanced loading of roofs.
2.
Drifting due to
adjacent
obstructions.
3.
Accumulations in valleys and adjacent to parapet walls and chimneys.
4.
Ice loads on cornices of at least one and one half times the roof snow load.
5.
Possible
impact
loadings from snow falling on structure from higher roofs.
6.
Effect on structure from dynamic loading caused by snow sliding off roof.
7.
Snow sliding off roof and dynamically loading sidewalls by being forced against same due to snow embankment adjacent to the structure.
8.
Protection of entrances, exits and windows from the danger of falling icicles and snow sliding off pitched roofs.
9.
Ice weight where it will refreeze on unheated overhangs after having melted and run off from portions of roofs with heat below same.
10.
Projections through the roof, such as ventilation and plumbing vents, which may be torn off or damaged by sliding snow.
11.
Gas meter locations must be positioned in areas where they are least effected by ice and snow accumulations from roofs above. Where gas meter shed and protections are required the structure must be designed to resist 1.4 times the snow load requirement for the land/structure
site
snow load.
12.
All exterior decks must be designed based on the snow load criteria and requirements for the
project
location. Structural design must take into consideration the weight of total accumulation, impact loading from roofs above, uplift and mechanical connections and soil/foundation capabilities.

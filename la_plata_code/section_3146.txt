Chapter 65 Animas Valley Zone Districts and Economic Development Areas
Overview
This
code
is premised upon
performance-based zoning
and the type of standards more particularly described in the overview of chapter 70. However, in the Animas Valley,
traditional zoning
has been adopted. This chapter contains detailed
use
,
density
and
lot
standards for
development
covered by the Animas Valley Land Use Plan (AVLUP). Applications for
development
in the Animas Valley should refer to this chapter to determine (1) if the proposed use is allowed and what type of review procedures apply, (2) what minimum
lot size
, maximum
density
, minimum
open space
and maximum
impervious coverage
standards may apply, and (3) whether any supplemental use,
density
and
development
standards are applicable because of the property’s location in the Animas Valley River Corridor District or one of several Animas Valley Neighborhood Overlay Zoning Districts.
This chapter is also intended to accommodate future placement of unique standards that may apply to economic
development
areas, once designated under section 66-38, or future overlay areas that may be adopted relative to requirements for
affordable housing
or other matters.
Sec. 65-3 Animas Valley Land Use Plan Districts: use, density and lot standards
I.
Fifteen-acre minimum single-family residential.
A.
Purpose of district. The purpose of the fifteen-acre minimum
single-family residential
district is to provide a reasonable use of land that predominantly has no
central water
or sewer service, and which lies outside the river corridor district. Preserving the rural character is of prime importance in this area.
B.
Uses permitted by right. Uses permitted by right in the fifteen-acre minimum single-family residential district include: single-family residential,
granny flats
, commercial livestock and agriculture-related operations and their accessory structures. Clustering is permitted for subdivisions that maintain a minimum five (5) acre lot for each dwelling unit and a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the overall site as landscaped and dedicated open space. The calculated land area remaining between minimum lot sizes and required open space may be used for internal roads, greater lot sizes or more open space. This surplus land area may not be used to justify additional dwelling units.
C.
Special uses permitted by a minor land use permit. Special uses permitted by a minor
land use permit
in the fifteen-acre minimum
single-family residential
district include: bed and breakfasts of no more than ten (10) guestrooms, plant nurseries and greenhouses, day care centers, and public and
quasi-public facilities

A.
The type of building use and occupancy proposed;
B.
If residential development is proposed, the number of dwelling units;
C.
If a non-residential use is proposed, the gross square footage of enclosed floor area of such non-residential development.

III.
Additional calculation considerations.
A.
If the type of new development proposed has multiple principal uses, as opposed to secondary or accessory uses commonly associated with a principal use, each identified principal use shall be subject to a separate impact fee calculation, unless the applicant can document that the effect of the multiple uses is to reduce the number of fire and emergency service calls generated by each individual principal use.
B.
If the type of new development is a qualifying home business, as defined in the La Plata County Land Use Code, the gross square footage of floor area of the portion devoted to the non-residential development shall be calculated and this portion shall be the sole amount due for payment of the fire impact fee.
C.
All impact fee calculations shall be based upon the fee schedule adopted by county resolution and in effect at the time of building permit application.
IV.
Eligibility for credits.
Credits against the base impact fee calculated to be due from a new development pursuant to subsections I and II above, shall be made to avoid over-charging an applicant when any one or more of the following circumstances exist:

A landowner or developer is already required to pay an impact fee or other similar development charge for another capital facility used to provide a similar fire, rescue, and emergency service, whether by agreement or otherwise.
B.
A landowner or developer has voluntarily contributed money or in-kind assets for such a capital facility.
V.
Equitable apportionment of credit
.  Credits shall be equitably assigned to properties for which development fees, funds or assets were provided.
VI.
Application for credits.
Applications for credits shall be made by the applicant at or before the time of building permit application on a credit application/calculation form provided by the community development department.  The application form shall be completed and shall be accompanied by appropriate documentary evidence demonstrating the eligibility of the applicant for the credit. The community development department shall verify the eligibility for, and the amount of, the credit due.  The credit shall be applied against the base impact fee; provided, however, that in no event shall the credit exceed the amount of the base impact fee otherwise calculated to be due pursuant to this section.
VII.
Calculation of credits.
In calculating the credit due to the applicant, the applicant shall provide sufficient documentation to the community development department to verify the amount of the fee paid or costs incurred by the applicant or developer for the capital facility identified in the district capital improvement plan.  The credit shall be the sum of the applicant’s expenditures for a capital improvement identified in the district capital improvement plan.

Sec. 44-23 Relationship to other requirements of the land use and building codes.
The road impact fee requirement shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible uses of property, the density/intensity of development, applicable design and improvement standards, the subdivision of land or any other applicable standards, requirements or conditions imposed by the county code, which requirements shall remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect to
new development
. The road impact fee requirement is additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the county on new development or applicable to the issuance of a
land use permit
or
building permit
for new development; provided, however, that if pursuant to any other provision of the county code, the developer has been or is being required to construct or pay other fees or assessments for a
county road improvement

Sec. 44-24 Calculation of applicable road impact fee.
I.
Base fee calculation. Upon receipt of a complete application for a
building permit
or
qualifying land use permit
, the
community development department
shall determine the following:
A.
The type of land use proposed;
B.
If a residential land use is proposed, the number, type, and size (in square feet) of
dwelling units
(or, if an expansion of existing residential, the amount of increased square footage);
C.
If a non-residential land use is proposed, the
gross floor area
(in square feet) of such non-residential development (or, if an expansion of existing non-residential, the amount of increased square footage).
After making these determinations, the community development department shall multiply the number of dwelling units (by size categories) and/or the gross floor area (by land use type and per 1,000 square feet) by the applicable listing in the
road impact fee schedule
adopted by resolution of the board, or revised thereafter pursuant to the requirements of this division, to derive the base impact fee due. For
new development
that involves the expansion of existing development, the community development department shall assess the impact fee only on new dwelling units and additional square footage (of both residential and non-residential developments). The calculation of the impact fee for the addition of new square footage to an existing dwelling unit shall be as set forth in a separate schedule adopted for residential additions. The impact fee schedules shall be maintained and published as a new “Road Impact Fee” subpart of the “Community Development” section of Appendix A of the code.
II.
Additional calculation considerations.
A.
If the type of new development proposed is not expressly listed in the fee schedule, the community development department shall:
1.
Identify the listed land use with the most similar trip generation characteristics and calculate the base impact fee based on that land use; or
2.
Identify the broader land use category within which the proposed new development would most appropriately fit and calculate the base impact fee pursuant to that land use; or
3.
Authorize the applicant to conduct a
traffic analysis
pursuant to subsection 74-3.IV of the county code for the proposed new development. The traffic analysis shall be paid for by the applicant, performed by a qualified traffic engineer, and subject to the approval of the county engineer.  The county, at its own expense, may perform an additional traffic analysis to verify the applicant’s traffic analysis.  For a new development that is not expressly listed in the fee schedule and is within a subdivision that was required to provide a traffic analysis as part of the subdivision’s approval by the board, the applicant may utilize a traffic analysis that is compliant with subsection 74-3.IV of the code to calculate the appropriate fee.
B.
If the new development proposed has multiple types of uses, each identified use shall be subject to a separate impact fee calculation, unless the applicant can document that the effect of the multiple uses is to reduce the number of trips otherwise generated by each individual principal land use.
C.
If the type of new development is a qualifying land use permit for an accessory use or
accessory rural occupation
, as defined in chapter 62 of this code, the gross floor area of the portion devoted to the non-residential development shall be calculated and this portion shall be the sole amount due at the time of collection specified in section 44-25.  If the type of new development is a building permit for an existing residential structure that received an accessory use or accessory rural occupation
land use permit
, the gross floor area of the portion devoted to the non-residential development shall be calculated.
D.
All impact fee calculations shall be based upon the fee schedule adopted by county resolution and in effect at the time of complete application for the building permit or qualifying land use permit.
III.
Eligibility for credits.
Credits against the base impact fee calculated to be due from a new development pursuant to subsections I and II, above, shall be made to avoid over-charging an applicant when any one or more of the following circumstances exist:
A.
The applicant is within a subdivision that was approved by the board and the subdivision constructed all or a portion of a
county road improvement
in accordance with the
road improvement plan
;
B.
The applicant has previously paid a fee or fees for all or a portion of a county road improvement required to serve the development for which the base impact fee is to be assessed; or
C.
The applicant is within the jurisdiction of a local improvement district, public improvement district, or special district, which assesses the applicant for all or a portion of county road improvements which is identified in the road improvement plan.  Credit shall not be provided for the value of any road
right-of-way
or associated acquisition costs that may have been dedicated, since right-of-way costs are not included in the impact fee calculations.
IV.
Equitable apportionment of credits.
Credits for county road improvements shall be equitably assigned to properties within the subdivisions for which the improvements were provided.
V.
Application for credits.
Applications for credits shall be made by the applicant before the issuance of a building permit or qualifying land use permit on a credit application/calculation form provided by the community development department.  The application form shall be completed and shall be accompanied by appropriate documentary evidence demonstrating the eligibility of the applicant for the credit. The community development department shall verify the eligibility for, and the amount of, the credit due.  The credit shall be applied against the base impact fee; provided, however, that in no event shall the credit exceed the amount of the base impact fee otherwise calculated to be due pursuant to subsections 44-24.I and II, above.
VI.
Calculation of credits.
In calculating the credit due to the applicant, the applicant shall provide sufficient documentation to the community development department to verify:
A.
The amount of the fee paid by the applicant or developer for a county road improvement identified in the road improvement plan; and/or
B.
The amount of construction costs incurred by the applicant or developer for a county road improvement identified in the road improvement plan, or the estimate of such cost made at the time of the
improvement agreement
.
The credit shall be the sum of the applicant’s expenditures for fees and construction costs (of which no more than twenty (20) percent may be related to engineering and construction management) for a county road improvement identified in the
road improvement plan
.

Time of collection.
The county shall collect the impact fee due at the time of issuance of a
building permit
or
qualifying land use permit
, unless: (1) the applicant was determined to be exempt pursuant to subsection 44-22.II; (2) the applicant was determined to be entitled to a full credit pursuant to subsection 44-24.III; or (3) the applicant appealed the county’s determination of the impact fee due pursuant to section 44-28 and a bond or other surety in a form acceptable to the
community development department
and in the amount of the proposed impact fee, as determined by the community development department, was posted with the county.

I.
Establishment of accounts.
Impact fee funds collected shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account which clearly identifies the purpose for which the fee was imposed.  All interest earned or money deposited to the account shall be credited to and shall be considered funds of the account. The county shall establish appropriate accounting procedures and controls to ensure that the road impact fee funds are properly deposited, accounted for and appropriated in accordance with the requirements of this division and other legal requirements applicable to impact fees.
II.
Appropriation of road impact fee funds.
Impact fee funds may only be appropriated for road improvement costs for
county road improvements
identified in the
road improvement plan
, or for the payment of principal, interest and other financing costs on contracts, bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the county to finance such costs for county road improvements identified in the road improvement plan.  The county may enter into an agreement with one or more municipalities to use road impact fees collected from
new development
in the
unincorporated
area to fund, wholly or partially, eligible county road improvements identified in the road improvement plan and located within the municipal boundaries.
III.
Restrictions on appropriations.
A.
Road impact fee funds shall only be appropriated for county road improvements identified in the road improvement plan.
B.
Impact fees shall be appropriated within ten (10) years of the beginning of the county
fiscal year
immediately succeeding the date of impact fee collection, unless such period is extended. An extension may be approved if the appropriation is for a county road improvement provided in the road improvement plan that requires more than ten (10) years to plan, design and construct and the demand for such county road improvement is generated in whole or in part by the new development or the county road improvement will serve the development.  Impact fee funds will be deemed to be appropriated in the order they were received.
C.
Impact fees may not be appropriated or used for personnel, operations, maintenance or repair of county roads.

Sec. 44-27 Refunds.
I.
Eligibility for refund.
Refunds may be requested by an applicant who paid the impact fee in the following circumstances:
A.
The
building permit
or
qualifying land use permit
upon which the impact fee was imposed, calculated and collected expired or was revoked prior to the
commencement of construction
or use; and the funds paid have not yet been appropriated at the time of a complete application for refund; and a new building permit or qualifying land use permit will be needed to develop the property; or
B.
The county failed to appropriate the impact fees paid by the applicant in compliance with the timing or other applicable requirements of subsection 44-26.III; or
C.
The applicant amends its building permit or qualifying land use permit to reduce the amount of development after the building permit or qualifying land use permit was issued and after the impact fee was paid, provided that the impact fee was not appropriated; or
D.
The
new development
(1) obtains a certificate of occupancy from the
community development department
for one or more
dwelling units
; (2) applicant submits written proof to the community development department that such unit(s) is deemed to be a qualified affordable or
attainable housing
unit(s) through participation in one of the programs identified in paragraph 44-22.II.C above; and (3) the funds paid have not yet been appropriated at the time of a complete application for refund.
II.
Procedure for making refunds.
All requests for refunds shall be made by the current owner of the property on a refund application form provided by the community development department. The applicant must submit the following: a title report showing the applicant is the current owner of the property; proof that an impact fee was paid (i.e., a receipt or comparable evidence); and evidence that one (1) of the circumstances set forth in subsection 44-27.I, above occurred. To demonstrate compliance with paragraph 44-27.I.D, the applicant must provide verification from the La Plata County Regional Housing Alliance that the new development is participating in an identified affordable/attainable housing program and the specific dwelling unit(s) for which the refund is requested are qualified as affordable or attainable units and not market-rate units.

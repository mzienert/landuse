Editor's note—Ordinance No. 2025-01, adopted February 11, 2025, deleted Article I of Chapter 38 in its entirety and replaced the provisions contained within Ordinance No. 2025-01 from those of Res. Nos. 2014-17 and 2018-02, and Ord. Nos. 2022-01 and 2024-01 as the current provisions regarding use of county property.
Sec. 38-1. General provisions.
The county owns and operates real properties which enable the county to deliver efficient and effective services to the citizens of La Plata County.  Except as set forth in this article, all county property, both real and personal, are non-public forums and are reserved solely for official government business. The board finds that certain regulations are needed to meet the county’s obligations to responsibly manage its real property, to meet its obligations for the orderly and safe operation of its facilities and to provide certain designated public or limited public forums for free speech by citizens.  The board further finds that certain conduct on county-owned properties is a threat to public safety and health and interferes with the public’s ability to use county-owned property for its intended use.

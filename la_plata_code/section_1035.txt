Sec. 67-1 General purpose and applicability
I.
Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare, to encourage well-planned, stable neighborhoods and to protect the county's natural environment by:
A.
Ensuring certain subdivision proposals are in general conformance with the goals, policies, actions and other provisions of the comprehensive plan, applicable district plan and provisions of this code;
B.
Preventing development of areas subject to flood, geologic hazard, wildfire, radiation, noise and air pollution or other environmental hazards unless such hazards can be mitigated;
C.
Encouraging subdivision design that protects wildlife habitat, wetlands, native vegetation, existing landforms and the county's historical, archeological and paleontological resources;
D.
Ensuring land intended for development is suited for the proposed uses;
E.
Coordinating the design and construction of roadway, street and utility systems;
F.
Requiring the cost of improvements necessary for the development of a proposed subdivision and of benefit to its eventual residents be paid by the proponent of such development;
G.
Making adequate provision for development of schools, roads, recreational facilities, open space and other infrastructure necessary to serve the needs of the county's population;
H.
Ensuring land is not subdivided unless the necessary infrastructure, services and facilities to support such development are available.
II.
Applicability and exemptions.
A.
Applicability. This chapter shall be applicable to all land divisions into two (2) or more resulting lots, where any of the resulting lots are less than thirty-five (35) acres in gross area, where the land division does not otherwise qualify for an exemption under this section or under C.R.S. § 30-28-101(10). However, where the applicant includes the acreage of lots that are thirty-five (35) acres or larger in the calculation of the subdivision’s permitted project density, then such lots shall be platted and included in the subdivision application and review. This chapter shall also apply to manufactured home subdivisions and to the creation of certain leasehold interests as described in subparagraph 67-1.II.B.1 and shall apply to the creation of condominiums, townhome dwellings, and other forms of airspace ownership or air-right subdivisions, as described and defined in C.R.S. § 38-33-101 et seq. No plat of a subdivision shall be used for purposes of sale, lease, or building development until approved under the provisions of this code.
B.
Exemptions. The board hereby determines that, in accordance with C.R.S. § 30-28-101(10)(d), the following divisions of land into separate parcels or interests are not within the purposes of C.R.S. § 30-28-101 et seq. and are hereby exempted from the definition of the terms “subdivision” and “subdivided land” but, in some instances, may still require a land use permit or other forms of approval.
1.
Creation of certain leasehold interests:
a.
The creation of separate interests or interests in common for lease but not for sale shall be exempt from the definition of the term "subdivision," except as otherwise specifically provided in this subsection.
b.
The creation of a leasehold interest in a parcel that is a portion of a larger parcel of land for any other term of years shall constitute a “subdivision” under this code if the county determines the lessor is using the exemption set forth in paragraph B of this subsection to circumvent or evade the subdivision regulations.
2.
Boundary adjustments and lot consolidations. The adjustment of lot lines or parcel boundaries without the creation of any additional lots or parcels, or the deletion of existing lot lines or parcel boundaries, shall be exempt from the definition of the term "subdivision," but shall be processed in accordance with the boundary adjustment and lot consolidation procedures in section 67-9.
3.
Clustered rural development process. Divisions of land under the clustered rural development described in section 67-7.
4.
Lots qualifying for legalization. Lots meeting the approval criteria for legalization under section 67-14.
5.
Agricultural exemption subdivision process. Divisions of land under the agricultural exemption subdivision described in section 67-6.
6.
Any division of land created by the court pursuant to the procedure set forth in C.R.S. § 30-28-101(10)(d) if the board has been given notice and opportunity to join as a party in interest in the proceeding for the purpose of raising the issue of an intent to evade the statutory requirements for subdivision of land.

Sec. 67-2 General approval criteria for preliminary and final plat
I.
Preliminary plat criteria.
The preliminary plat phase of the subdivision review process is an evaluation of the design and engineering aspects of a proposed subdivision as well as any relevant conceptual issues. All the technical aspects of the physical development of the proposed site will be evaluated to determine their compliance with required design, planning, performance and engineering standards. To approve a preliminary plat, the decision-making body shall review the subdivision for compliance with the general approval criteria stated in section 66-16.
II.
Final plat criteria
. The final phase of the review process consists of the review of the application for the final plat. Final plat submittals shall meet all the following criteria:
A.
Conformity to any and all conditions of approval set forth in the major land use permit approving the preliminary plat.
B.
The applicant has executed all required development improvements agreements.

Sec. 67-3 Major subdivisions
I.
Applicability.
The major subdivision procedures shall be applicable to all land divisions into four (4) or more lots.
II.
Overview of necessary applications.
A major subdivision is subject to a sketch plan review by the PC and a preliminary plat review by the board, followed by the administrative review of the final plat. Each step is a distinct process involving the submittal of an application, an application fee, required plans and reports, referrals of the proposal to other agencies, staff analysis and public hearings. At each step of the process, the design and engineering detail increases in order to relieve the applicant from major and potentially unnecessary expenses in situations that may require a redesign and a revision of expensive engineering or planning reports. A general description of these steps is outlined below. Approval at any step in the process does not ensure approval at the next step.
Figure 67-3 A: Overview of Major Subdivision Procedures provides an overview of the application steps that apply to the review major land use permits.
III.
Preliminary plat procedures.
Figure 67-3 B: Summary of Preliminary Plat Procedures identifies the application steps that apply to the review of a preliminary plat.
IV.
Requirements for phased development.
A.
Preliminary plats consistent with phasing plans. Review and approval of a phasing plan in conjunction with a sketch plan or conceptual development plan shall be required for any subdivision proposed in phases. Each preliminary plat shall be consistent with the phasing plan approved under such sketch plan or conceptual development plan.
B.
Phased final plats. The preliminary plat may provide for phasing of final plat approvals as determined by the director based upon consideration of the design, size, and complexity of the subdivision and associated improvements. Such phasing of the final plats shall not require the prior approval of a sketch plan or conceptual development plan; however, it shall require a phasing plan be submitted and approved as part of the preliminary plat application. The locations and schedule of phases shall be clearly stated and indicated on the plat and in supporting documentation. The improvements and drainage plans and specifications shall also address in detail the subdivision improvements to be constructed and completed in association with each phase.
V.
Effect of approval.
A.
No vested rights. Preliminary plats shall not be construed to be site specific development plans.
B.
Preliminary plat approval period. Preliminary plat approval is valid for one (1) year after approval by the board. An approved preliminary plat shall be of no further force and effect if the final plat application for the subdivision is not submitted within one (1) year of the date of the preliminary plat's approval by the decision-making body.
C.
Approval period for preliminary plat for phased final plats. If the approved preliminary plat provides for phasing of final plats, and a final plat application for any phase of a subdivision is not submitted within the time specified in the approved phasing plan, then the preliminary plat approval shall be of no further force or effect. For phased subdivisions, an approved final plat for any phase of the preliminary plat shall extend the life of the remaining preliminary plat according to the approved phasing plan, or if not specified in an approved phasing plan, for an additional one (1) year from the date the final plat is approved. If successive final plats are not submitted within this one (1) year period, or within the period specified in an approved phasing plan, then the preliminary plat approval shall be of no further force or effect for those portions of the subject property not covered by an approved final plat.

Sec. 67-7 Clustered rural development
I.
Purpose.
The clustered rural development is comprised of two (2) components: the residential cluster and the conservation area. The residential cluster is the portion of the parcel that is subdivided into lots for single-family residential and accessory uses. The conservation area is the larger portion of the development parcel and is conserved primarily for agriculture uses and open space uses. The purpose of the CRD option is to:
A.
Recognize the current thirty-five (35) acre exemption law and implement provisions of C.R.S. § 30-28-401 et seq.
B.
Preserve and protect land such as agricultural land, open space, distinct landscapes, ecosystems, wildlife habitat and critical areas.
C.
Ensure development maintains the character of rural lands with contiguity to agricultural lands suitable for long-range agriculture operations.
D.
Develop new methods that encourage the retention of agricultural land as a productive resource.
E.
Facilitate cooperation among neighboring landowners to create a single proposal for clustering on a portion of property and conservation of the remainder.
F.
Provide flexibility in land use regulations by responding to the needs of the agricultural community.
II.
Applicability.
Pursuant to C.R.S. § 30-28-101(10)(d), the board hereby establishes CRD divisions as exempt from the definition of subdivision but subject to the minor subdivision review set forth in section 67-4. The CRD is a voluntary option and process under C.R.S. § 30-28-401 et seq. that may be used for any land in the county, other than in the AVLUP, meeting the criteria of this section that involves a single lot at least seventy (70) acres or more in size or two (2) or more contiguous lots that, when combined, comprise at least seventy (70) acres or more in size.
III.
Procedures.
The review process for a CRD subdivision shall be in accordance with the minor subdivision procedures set forth in section 67-4. No later than ten (10) days after approval of a CRD, the county shall notify CDOWR of such approval and provide CDOWR with a copy of the approved CRD.
IV.
Standards specific to clustered rural development process.
In addition to the general approval criteria for land use permits outlined in section 66-16, CRD divisions shall also comply with the following standards.
A.
The CRD shall be for single-family residential and accessory uses only. The density shall not exceed two (2) units for each thirty-five (35) acre increment. The layout of the residential cluster shall support the viability of existing agricultural activities and protect significant natural resources.
B.
No less than two-thirds (2/3) of the parcel, or if more than one parcel, two-thirds (2/3) of the total acreage of all parcels shall be preserved as contiguous open area to be used as open space, wildlife habitat, agricultural land, critical lands or similar uses.
C.
The conservation area shall be preserved for conservation purposes for a period not less than forty (40) years through an appropriate legal mechanism to be recorded with the county clerk and recorder imposing such restrictions. Acceptable legal mechanisms include, but are not limited to, a fee simple dedication or conservation easement to another governmental entity or a land trust that is a qualified organization as defined in subsection 170(h) of the Internal Revenue Code or is certified through the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies to hold conservation easements, provided that entity accepts the grant; a separate tract owned by a mandatory homeowners’ association or equivalent entity which agrees to be responsible for the management of the conservation area or other legal instrument, any of which must be approved by the county attorney.
D.
Development on the conservation parcel shall be restricted to accessory structures for agricultural use. Use of the conservation parcel should be limited to activities such as:
1.
Agricultural production and associated activities;
2.
General ranching, livestock and animal raising, not including feed lots;
3.
Use of motorized equipment needed for farming, ranching or management of the open space;
4.
Passive recreational uses such as but not limited to: hiking, cross country skiing and equestrian trails, provided the area is primarily left in its undisturbed natural condition and the recreational use is not for profit;
5.
Sanctuary or preserve for wildlife, fishing, forest or natural area;
6.
Other uses approved in the conservation easement or management plan.
E.
The proposed division and development of the land shall maintain the opportunity for agricultural production on the most agriculturally productive and viable portions of the land.
V.
Submittal requirements.
In addition to the general land use permit application submittal requirements set forth in section 66-11, applicant shall submit the following documents and materials:
A.
CRD report. A detailed report that includes the following information.
1.
The existing environmental conditions, including agricultural values, on the parcel(s) to be developed and the effects of the development on those conditions.
2.
A description of the conservation values to be preserved and the means to preserve those values as undeveloped open space, pasture or grazing lands, agriculture production, wildlife habitat or other conservation uses acceptable to the county. The description shall include information on the management of the land as well as a description, and legal proof, of the scope and nature of water rights available for irrigation or maintenance of habitat.
3.
A draft of the legal instrument intended to impose legally sufficient restrictions on the conservation parcel. The legal instrument shall specify all development and land division restrictions set forth in this code, the duration of the restrictions, the maintenance requirements and permitted uses for the conservation area.

Sec. 67-8 Obsolete subdivision
I.
Purpose.
An obsolete subdivision is one in which a substantial number of lots remain undeveloped and do not meet current subdivision requirements, including but not limited to, lot size, environmental conditions, and/or the provision of adequate infrastructure. Obsolete subdivisions may interfere with the orderly development of land within the county, perpetuate obsolete development standards and guidelines, threaten to impose substantial financial burdens on the county, and may create environmental problems and reduce the quality of life for persons who live in or near the obsolete subdivisions. Thus, this section addresses methods for the county to use for the purpose of eliminating interior lot lines of these obsolete subdivisions and preventing obsolete subdivisions from occurring.
II.
Applicability.
This section shall apply to all land that was validly platted at any time in unincorporated La Plata County. Illegal lots, parcels, development, structures, other improvements, signs and/or uses of land throughout unincorporated La Plata County are addressed through other provisions of this code.
III.
County merger of obsolete subdivisions.
A.
Initiation. The county may initiate the process to vacate all or any portion of a final plat of an obsolete subdivision within the county and thereby merge lots upon its own initiative or upon recommendation by the director.
B.
Limitation. The county may vacate only the final plat for that portion of an obsolete subdivision consisting of multiple, contiguous lots that are undeveloped and in common ownership.
C.
Resolution of intent. To initiate the merger process, the board shall adopt a resolution of intent to merge. The resolution shall set forth the reasons that the county desires to merge the final plat, or portions thereof, and shall instruct the director to send notice to the affected property owners as described in paragraph D below. Once a resolution of intent to merge has been adopted by the board, no development plan may be submitted or building permit issued until the matter has been finally decided by the board.
D.
Notice to owners and lienholders. Upon receipt of the resolution of intent to merge, the director shall send notice of the county's intent to merge to each record surface owner and lienholder of the affected parcels by certified mail. The notice shall specify that each owner may request a hearing on the proposed merger and shall specify action to be taken by the owner to request a hearing, including without limitation the requirement that the owner shall request the hearing within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date the notice is received by the owner. At the county’s discretion, it may also provide notice of the county’s intent to merge to any easement holder on the affected parcels and seek consent to vacate the easement if the merger is approved by the board.
E.
Public hearing. Where an owner of an affected parcel has timely requested a hearing on the proposed merger satisfying the requirements of this section, a public hearing on the merger shall be held before the board for the purpose of allowing the board to discuss with the owner of each affected parcel its reasons for proceeding with the merger and to give each owner the opportunity to submit any basis provided under law for challenging the merger.  In such case, notice of the time, place, and manner of the hearing shall be provided to each owner of the affected parcels and published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in a manner sufficient to notify the public of the time, place, and nature of the hearing. The hearing shall take place no sooner than ninety (90) days following the date of the notice required by paragraph D. No merger of parcels that is the subject of a hearing pursuant to this subsection shall be effective unless the owner of the parcels has given their consent to the merger of the parcels.
F.
Failure to request a hearing. Where an owner of an affected parcel fails to timely request a hearing on the proposed merger, no hearing is required, and the affected parcels shall be merged as provided in paragraph D.
G.
Merger of property. Upon conclusion of the hearing required by paragraph D, or upon an affected property owner’s failure to timely request a hearing, the board may, upon a majority vote, approve the merger of the parcels after making a finding that the properties are located within an obsolete subdivision and that the merger of the parcels will promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the county. The resolution approving the merger shall reference the subdivision name and the final plat on record with the county clerk and recorder, and if only a portion of the final plat is to be merged, specifically identifying the parcels to be merged.
H.
Recording. Upon completion of any merger of parcels under this section, the director shall file the resolution in the office of the clerk and recorder.
I.
Effect of merger. After all or part of a final plat for an obsolete subdivision has been vacated pursuant to this section:
1.
The merged parcels may not again be subdivided without first complying with the applicable regulations.
2.
The merger of all the parcels within an obsolete subdivision shall also vacate all county easements and rights-of-way designated on the final plat, unless the resolution of merger specifically identifies public easements or rights-of-way that are not vacated. Merger of parcels shall not have the effect of vacating any other easements not described in this paragraph, which are shown on the final plat, unless the holders of those easements have consented in writing to vacation of the easement.

Sec. 67-9 Boundary adjustments and lot consolidations
I.
Applicability.
Boundary adjustments are adjustments of property lines that do not create any additional lots or parcels. A lot consolidation includes the deletion of existing property lines. All boundary adjustments and lot consolidations are subject to county review according to this section except where all existing and proposed lots are and will be greater than thirty-five (35) acres and no such existing lot, regardless of the acreage, has been shown on a plat signed by the chair of the board.
II.
Procedures.
Boundary adjustments and lot consolidations shall be processed according to the administrative land use permit procedures in section 66-18.
III.
Approval criteria.
The approval criteria for boundary adjustments and lot consolidations are the general approval criteria for land use permits outlined in section 66-16 and following specific criteria:
A.
Boundary adjustment and lot consolidation shall only be required to meet the following standards rather than standards generally applicable to other developments requiring an administrative land use permit:
1.
Water. Proof of water pursuant to section 70-4 shall be required if an adjusted or deleted property line directly and negatively impacts a lot’s water source or infrastructure.
2.
Sewer. Proof of sewer pursuant to section 70-3 shall be required if an adjusted or deleted property line directly and negatively impacts a lot’s method of sewage disposal. Unless served by a central sewer system, a boundary adjustment or lot consolidation resulting in a proposed lot less than one (1) acre shall be considered directly and negatively impacting the lot’s method of sewage disposal.
3.
Driveway; access. A new driveway permit and proof of legal access complying with chapter 74 shall be required if an adjusted or deleted property line directly and negatively impacts a lot’s current access.
4.
Legal lots. All existing lots shall be legal lots of record.
5.
Lot design specifications. The proposal shall not cause a new violation or failure to comply with this code, except as otherwise specifically allowed by subsection IV below in the AVLUP. All proposed lots shall conform to the lot design specifications set forth in subsection 67-15.III unless the existing lot is nonconforming pursuant to chapter 79. Lot consolidations may include existing nonconforming lots regardless of the proposed lots’ resulting acreage. Boundary adjustments may only include existing nonconforming lots so long as not increasing the degree of nonconformity.
IV.
Nonconforming lots in the Animas Valley River Corridor District.
The following additional provisions shall apply to boundary adjustments for nonconforming lots within the River Corridor District of the AVLUP only. An applicant may submit a boundary adjustment application to adjust the boundaries of existing, adjacent nonconforming lots of record, subject to compliance with the following procedures and approval criteria:
A.
The review process shall follow the administrative land use permit procedures in section 66-18, except that the director shall refer the application to the board, who shall take final action on the boundary adjustment plat.
B.
The boundary adjustment shall be subject to the following additional approval criteria:
1.
The resulting lots allow for no more dwelling units than originally allowed for on the two (2) parcels;
2.
The resulting lots are no smaller than twelve (12) acres;
3.
The plat shall designate minimum building setbacks of fifty (50) feet from all property lines;
4.
The board may require specific building envelopes to be designated on the boundary adjustment, if it finds that such envelopes are reasonably necessary to mitigate adverse visual or other impacts on the Animas River or public roads, or to mitigate adverse impact on wetlands, wildlife, or agricultural operations.

I.
Plat modifications.
Unless qualifying for a plat adjustment pursuant to subsection II below, or an amended plat pursuant to subsection III below, no use or development authorized by an approved or recorded plat pursuant to this code shall be altered, changed, or otherwise modified but rather shall require a new land use permit through the applicable land division procedure. Corrections to a recorded plat pursuant to C.R.S. § 38-51-111 shall be processed under section 67-10.
II.
Adjustments to an approved but not recorded plat.
A.
Applicability. The director may make adjustments to an approved but not yet recorded plat to provide expeditious relief to a permitee when an insubstantial change to a plat can solve a practical difficulty, assure compliance with applicable state or federal laws, or implement a permitee’s changed intentions for a permitted development. The director may issue a director determination letter to grant adjustments as follows:
1.
Permitted adjustments to plats. The director may grant an adjustment in the following circumstances:
a.

I.
Vacation of utility easements.
A.
Applicability. This section applies to any change or vacation to an existing utility easement shown on a recorded plat signed by the chair of the board when such change or vacation is not part of an application that requires a new plat, for example a subdivision, boundary adjustment or lot consolidation application, in which case such change or vacation should be processed as part of that application.
B.
Procedures. A change or vacation to which this section applies shall be processed as an amended plat.
C.

Applicability. Notwithstanding any applicable section in this code, this subsection II on naming applies to applications for all land use permits and any owner who seeks to change an existing name.
B.
Standards.
1.
Proposed subdivision names shall not duplicate existing subdivision names within the county. Nor shall subdivision names be the reversal or variation of an existing name that, in the opinion of the director, may unnecessarily contribute to confusion for emergency responders.
2.
Naming of streets and addressing. Consistent and appropriate street naming and addressing procedures and standards contribute to the planned and orderly development of the county in a way that assists first responders in maintaining the public health, safety and general welfare of persons within the county. Any person who creates a new street, wants to name or re-name an existing street or requests the assignment of a new or revised address shall meet the minimum standards set forth in the naming and addressing policy and guidance documents made available by the La Plata County GIS Department, which policy and guidance documents are intended to implement these standards and which may be amended by such department to comport to current industry standards.
III.
Lot design and density standards.
A.
Topography. To the maximum extent practicable, all lots shall be designed to conform to the existing topography in such a way as to avoid future problems or conflicts with access, drainage or utility service, as well as to preserve existing natural features such as unusual rock formations and bodies of water.
B.
Shape. Lots shall have a depth to width ratio of no greater than four (4) to one (1), or minimum buildable area of no greater than three (3) to one (1). Depth and width shall be calculated using the average width and depth for the lot.
C.
Layout.
1.
A single lot shall not be divided by a public or private road, alley or another lot; unless the director determines that the lot layout protects the natural features of the site or creates additional open space.
2.
Side lot lines should be at approximate right angles or radial to the road right-of-way or centerline.
3.
Each lot shall have access to a private street, a private access easement or right-of-way, or a dedicated street.
4.
Through lots shall be avoided, except where necessary to buffer residential development from conflicting uses, or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography.

Sufficient buildable area. All lots shall have sufficient buildable area to accommodate the planned structures and shall have driveway access in compliance with chapter 74; however, buildable areas need not be shown as a designated building envelope on the plat unless needed for mitigation pursuant to paragraph E below.
E.
Designated building envelopes to mitigate impacts. In general, building envelopes designated on plats should only be used when necessary to achieve a guideline or standard. Building envelopes may be utilized to mitigate adverse impacts to surrounding properties pursuant to a compatibility assessment and to avoid or accommodate critical lands such as rivers, wetlands, floodways, steep slopes and geologic hazards and to accommodate clustering. Building envelopes established on plats shall be accompanied by a plat notice describing the use and development limitations or allowances within both the building envelope and the area of the lot outside of the building envelope.
F.
Lot size and density review. The applicant shall propose the density and sizes of the lots intended for the development. The advisory and decision-making bodies shall review the adequacy of the lot sizes and appropriateness of the density proposed using the required standards outlined in this paragraph F. If the advisory or decision-making body finds that proposed lot sizes or density do not meet standards in this section, they shall request alternative lot sizes, numbers of lots or both. The permit application shall be denied or continued until the appropriate lot sizes and density are proposed by the applicant. Unless otherwise provided in this code, the minimum lot size shall be determined by the following criteria:
1.
Minimum lot sizes and dimensions shall exclude street/and or road rights-of-way.
2.
Minimum lot sizes may be achieved by counting a prorated share of open space owned in common by all lot owners within the subject subdivision. For example, if the development qualifies for minimum ten thousand (10,000) square foot lots, and two thousand (2,000) square feet of lot area for each lot is included in an open space owned in common by all lot owners, then the minimum lot size may be reduced to eight thousand (8,000) square feet.
3.
The minimum lot size shall be three (3) acres if the lot is to be served by individual groundwater well and on-site wastewater treatment systems.
4.
The minimum lot size shall be one (1) acre if the lot is to be served by a central water or sewer system, but not both.
5.
The minimum lot size shall be ten thousand (10,000) square feet if the lot is served by a central water and sewer system.
6.
Lots for multi-family dwellings, townhome dwellings and commercial development may be less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet if the lot is served by a central water and sewer system.
7.
Regardless of the minimum lot sizes provided in subparagraphs 3 to 6 above, the appropriate minimum lot sizes and density shall also be reviewed and determined based on the following:
a.
A compatibility assessment pursuant to section 70-5;
b.
In the Animas Valley Land Use Plan, the minimum lot sizes and density shall meet the applicable district requirements of chapter 65;

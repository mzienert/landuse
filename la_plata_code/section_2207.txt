This Article is authorized by C.R.S. § 30-11-101(b) and (c). The purpose of this
Article
is to facilitate transferring
increments
of the conditional La Plata
County
Water Right
No. 1, La Plata County Water Right No. 2, and La Plata County Water Right No. 3 decreed to the La Plata County by Division 7 water court case In re La Plata County, 06CW99 (filed December 20, 2006) in a manner that is consistent with the aforementioned court decree, the
County Code
, and state law. Transferring increments to
water users
shall not constitute a "sale" as that term is used in
ARTICLE II
of this chapter and shall be specifically excluded from the procedures outlined in
ARTICLE II
of this chapter. The process for obtaining an increment does not confer on a water user a water right, a
land use permit
, a
building permit
, approval of a site specific development plan, or a vested property right pursuant to state statutes or common law.

Accessory uses. Limited commercial increments shall not be allowed for Class I accessory uses or accessory uses conducted without a land use permit pursuant to section 82-5 of this Code, except that, pursuant to subsection
94-50
(I), the board of county commissioners may approve a special exception allowing for up to one limited commercial increment per accessory use.

The application will result in the return flow being downstream of the depletion point for the watershed from which the increment is intended to be diverted.
The application is for an increment that will be used outside of the watershed from which the increment is intended to be diverted.
The application relies on water hauling.
The application is for a use that would qualify for an exempt well.

Diligence reports. The water user shall report to the planning director what actions were taken to diligently pursue the use of the full amount of the water user's increment. Such reports will be on a form provided by the planning director in October of every even number year. Failure to submit such reports to the planning director within 20

Sec. 94-48. - Deeds.
Issuing deeds. After a
water user
submits a written request for a deed and provides to the planning
director
a copy of a water court decree making an
increment
an
absolute water right
, the
county
shall convey by quitclaim deed that increment to the water user. The planning director shall be authorized to sign such deeds on behalf of the county, but such deeds shall be satisfactory in form and content to the county attorney. The planning director shall sign and issue the deeds in the same order that the written requests are received.
Abandonment. Deeds issued pursuant to subsection (I) above shall specifically provide that it is the intent of both the county and the water user to create a conditional fee interest in the water user and a right of entry in the county, meaning that a deeded increment is conveyed to the water user upon the condition that the
board of county commissioners
does not reasonably determine by resolution that the increment is at risk of being abandoned. If such a resolution is adopted, the deed shall specify that the water user consents to the county filing an action to quiet title and retake the increment. Any increment appearing on any abandonment list prepared by a division engineer pursuant to C.R.S. § 37-92-401 and C.R.S. § 37-92-402 shall create a rebuttable presumption that the increment is at risk of being abandoned.

water users
based on the priority established by the waiting list.

Effective on: 8/28/2012
Sec. 94-50. - Annual reports.
Special exceptions. If notified by the planning director pursuant to subsection 94-43(c)(4), a water user may request that the board of county commissioners approve a special exception as specifically contemplated in subsection 94-45(a)(3), subsection 94-45(a)(3)a., and subsection 94-45(a)(4) of this article. Special exception requests shall be in writing and shall state with specificity the grounds for the special exception. The planning director shall not charge an additional fee for a special exception request as long as the water user already paid the administrative processing fee as part of the initial application for an increment. The board of county commissioners shall review the special exception request within 40 business days of the request being filed with the planning director. The planning director shall file a report with the board of county commissioners recommending approval, conditional approval, or denial of the special exception request, and shall provide a copy of the report to the water user. The board of county commissioners may approve, conditionally approve, or deny the special exception request. Factors the board of county commissioners may consider include, but are not limited to the following:
The intended benefit to the water user, the county, and the community as a whole.
Any proposed water conservation equipment or techniques designed to reduce the total amount of water needed.
Competing uses for the water.
The public's best interest.
Appeals. A water user alleging that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or refusal made by the planning director based on or made in the enforcement of this article may appeal to the board of county commissioners. Such appeals shall be in writing, shall state with specificity the grounds of the appeal, and shall be filed with the planning director within 20 business days of the decision, order, requirement, or refusal being appealed. The board of county commissioners shall review the planning director's decision, order, requirement, or refusal within 40 business days of the appeal being filed with the planning director. The planning director shall file a report with the board of county commissioners recommending approval or denial of the appeal, and shall provide a copy of the report to the water user. The board of county commissioners may amend the planning director's decision, order, requirement, or refusal based on the same information and/or materials relied on by the planning director and the same applicable provisions from this article.

Effective on: 3/23/2017
Sec. 94-51. - Water service providers, ditch companies, and non-profits.
The
board of county commissioners
may execute contractual agreements transferring
increments
to
water service providers
and
ditch companies
. Such contractual agreements may specifically deviate from this article so long as the board of county commissioners determine that the provisions of the
06CW99 Court Decree are not violated and the public's best interest is served.

Water use agreements
. In the event a default under the terms of a water use agreement is believed to exist, the
county
shall give written notice thereof via certified mail to the
water user
setting a date for a hearing before the
board of county commissioners
to determine the existence of the default. The hearing shall be no less than ten
business days
after sending notice to the water user. Within 20 business days after such hearing, the board of county commissioners shall determine whether or not a default exists, and, if so, shall specify a reasonable time within which the water user shall be required to satisfactorily cure the default. If the water user fails to satisfactorily cure the default within the time specified by the board of county commissioners, the county shall terminate the water use agreement.
Deeds. In the event that a deeded
increment
is believed to be at risk of being abandoned, the county shall give written notice thereof via certified mail to the water user setting a date for a hearing before the board of county commissioners. The hearing shall be no less than ten business days after sending notice to the water user. Within 20 business days after such hearing, the board of county commissioners may reasonably determine by resolution if the deeded increment is at risk of being abandoned. If such a resolution is adopted, the county shall immediately file an action to quiet title and retake the portion of an increment pursuant to the deed's stated conditions. Any increment appearing on any abandonment list prepared by a division engineering pursuant to C.R.S. §§ 37-92-401 and 37-92-402 shall create a rebuttable presumption that the increment is at risk of being abandoned.

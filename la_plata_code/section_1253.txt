DIVISION 3. FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
Sec. 78-75. Areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones).
Located within the
special flood hazard areas
established in this chapter are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special
flood
hazards associated with
base flood
depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined
channel
does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow
may
be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
All
new construction
and
substantial improvements
of
residential
structures
have the
lowest floor
(including
basement
), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment
and other service
facilities
(including ductwork), elevated above the
highest adjacent grade
at least one foot above the depth number specified in feet on the applicable FIRM (at least three feet if no depth number is specified). Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement,
shall
be certified by a registered Colorado
Professional Engineer
, architect, or land surveyor. Such certification shall be submitted to the
floodplain administrator
.
All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures (with the exception of
critical facilities
as outlined in section 78-79);
Have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one foot above the depth number specified in feet on the applicable FIRM (at least three feet if no depth number is specified); or
Together with attendant
utility
and sanitary facilities be designed so that the structure is watertight to at least one foot above the base flood level with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.
A Colorado registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this chapter are satisfied.
Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.

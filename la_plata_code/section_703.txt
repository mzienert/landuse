Sec. 46-57. Unsecured trash, rubbish or refuse containers.
Basis/purpose. Bears, mountain lions, skunks, raccoons, magpies, crows, foxes, and coyotes are a few of the
wildlife
species living in close proximity to people in the
county
. Over the past several years human-wildlife conflict incidents dealing with these species have dramatically increased. Unsecured and unattended trash containers that are left in the open for extended periods of time are a strong attractant for wildlife and a primary cause of conflicts between wildlife and people.
Intent. The
board
of county
commissioners
finds and declares that the purpose of this section is to protect the public health and welfare by either requiring the
use
of secured and wildlife-proof trash containers or restricting the times and dates in which residents or other property
owners
or users
may
leave unattended and unsecured trash,
rubbish
and refuse containers in the open and along rights-of-way within the unincorporated territory of the county and county-controlled lands.

X.
Liberal construction. This section shall be liberally construed so as to further its purposes.
XI.
Severability. If any provision, clause, sentence, or paragraph of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions of this section that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are declared to be severable.

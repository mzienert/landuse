Sec. 90-1 Purposes and effective date
I.
Purpose.
The county’s shared objective with the State of Colorado for
oil and gas development
is to protect public health, safety and welfare, the environment and wildlife resources by establishing a regulatory framework for new and existing
OGL
s
and
OGFs
.  Oil and gas operations in the
unincorporated
areas of the county are activities that necessitate reasonable regulations to ensure all property owners, mineral and otherwise, have the right to enjoy their property and its benefits safely and peaceably. Specifically, these regulations are necessary to:
A.
Ensure oil and gas operation proposals are in general conformance with the goals, policies, actions and other provisions of the
comprehensive plan
(including the applicable
district plan
) as well as strict compliance with the goals, policies, standards and other provisions of this code.
B.
Ensure a comprehensive land use framework and transparent public process for the development and operation of OGLs and OGFs and establish criteria for the review and approval or denial of new applications.
C.
Avoid
adverse impacts
from oil and gas operations to public health, safety and welfare, the environment and wildlife resources and minimize and mitigate the extent and severity of those impacts that cannot be avoided. C.R.S. § 34-60-103(5.5).
D.
Provide for the orderly production of available mineral resources.
E.
Mitigate the on-site and off-site impacts of oil and gas operations through the application of best available technologies and other
BMPs
.
F.
Confirm the financial and insurance capacities of operators to ensure timely and effective construction, completion, production, removal and
reclamation
of OGLs, OGFs and related
infrastructure
in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, and conditions of approval.
II.
Coordinated development; balancing interests.
Under state law, the surface and mineral estates are separate and distinct interests in
real property
, and one may be severed from the other.  Subject to compliance with the provisions of this code and any other applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, owners of subsurface mineral interests have certain legal rights and privileges, including the right to use that part of the surface estate reasonably required to extract and develop subsurface mineral interests. Similarly, owners of the surface estate have certain legal rights and privileges, including the right to have the mineral estate developed in a reasonable manner and to have adverse impacts associated with the development of the mineral estate mitigated.
III.
Effective date; repeal.
A.
The effective date of this chapter is August 1, 2023.
B.
Repeal. Except to the extent necessary to enforce compliance with permits issued pursuant thereto or issued prior to the effective date, former chapter 90 of the La Plata County Land Use Code is hereby repealed on the effective date of this chapter. The repeal of former chapter 90 does not revive any other provisions, resolutions, ordinance, codes or other regulations repealed by this provision.

Sec. 90-4 Permits and procedures
I.
Permit(s) and reviews required.
A.
All activities to which this chapter 90 applies are deemed development, and a land use permit issued by the county is required prior to engaging in any such development. The specific uses addressed in this chapter require a unique balancing of rights (surface estate owner, mineral estate owner, surrounding landowners, and the broader community) against the risks of adverse impacts sometimes associated with oil and gas development. As frequently noted, the processes, submittal requirements, and standards set forth in this chapter are in addition to the more general requirements of other parts of the land use code, such as some definitions in chapter 62, the processes in chapter 66, the standards in chapters 70 and 74 and the provisions of chapters 79 through 81.  A more particular procedure, submittal requirement, or standard in chapter 90 will prevail over a less particular provision elsewhere in the land use code, and a more restrictive procedure, submittal requirement, or standard in chapter 90 will prevail over a less restrictive provision elsewhere in the land use code.
B.
There are two (2) categories of county oil and gas permits and a subsequent review process for transfers of permits and final reclamation subject to chapter 90.  The subsequent review process is described in paragraph 90-4.II.E.  The two permits are:
1.
Minor. A minor oil and gas permit is a type of administrative land use permit reviewed and approved by the
CDD
pursuant to sections 66-5 and 66-18, subject to the unique procedures in subsection 90-4.II.  The following types of development require a minor oil and gas permit:
a.
A working pad surface built with one (1) or more wells and operated to produce liquid petroleum or natural gas, including accessory equipment required for such production.
b.
Pipelines which extend less than one-quarter mile (1,320 feet) from the wellhead and ancillary equipment including but not limited to drip stations, vent stations, pigging facilities, chemical injection stations and valve boxes.
c.
Temporary storage and construction staging yards in place for less than six (6) months that are not involved in well drilling or production operations at the site.
2.
Major. A major oil and gas permit is a type of major land use permit ultimately reviewed and approved by the board pursuant to sections 66-7 and 66-21, subject to the unique procedures in subsection 90-4.II.  The following types of development require a major oil and gas permit:
a.
Centralized facilities.
b.
Water injection, centralized water transfer stations, centralized water pump stations and associated facilities serving multiple well pads.
c.
Any permanent accessory equipment, facility or structure related to the production of oil or gas which contains internal combustion engines with a cumulative horsepower, de-rated for elevation, of two hundred (200) BHP or greater.
d.
Transmission line or any pipeline that extends one-quarter mile (1,320 feet) or more from the wellhead and ancillary equipment served by such pipeline or for which the power of eminent domain may be exercised.
e.
Any other oil and gas operation,
OGF
, or
OGL
not meeting the definition of minor oil and gas facility.
C.
Vested rights.  The vesting for an approved oil and gas development under chapter 90 shall be as for all site-specific development plans pursuant to subparagraph 66-13.III.C.1. If the vesting of the site-specific development plan has expired, the applicant must reapply for and be granted a new approval to proceed with the project.  Any development activity occurring under an expired site-specific development plan or permit shall be subject to the enforcement and penalty provisions of chapter 80 and section 90-18.  One extension of time up to one (1) year may be approved by the director if all the following are satisfied:
1.
A written request for the extension is submitted to the CDD no later than forty-five (45) days prior to the date the site-specific development plan or permit is set to expire.
2.
The operator provides proof necessary for the director to determine, in the director’s sole discretion, that the project remains capable of satisfying the provisions of this chapter 90 and the conditions of approval for the permit without the need for new or revised conditions of approval or mitigation techniques.
3.
The applicant provides a written explanation for why the extension is warranted considering all relevant circu
mstances including, but not limited to, the size and complexity of the development, economic cycles and market conditions.
4.
The surface owner has consented in writing to the extension.
All other extensions of time to complete development pursuant to an approved site-specific development plan or an issued oil and gas permit must first be approved by the board pursuant to subparagraph 66-13.III.C.3.
D.
Subsequent review procedures subject to call-up. The county recognizes that many oil and gas developments require extensive investment of time, resources, and money to accomplish. In recognition of this fact, once conditions of approval are satisfied and development is timely completed to vest the rights outlined in the permit, the owner or operator generally enjoys the right to exercise the privileges granted under the permit, subject to an ongoing duty to comply with applicable laws as well as the terms and conditions of the permit. However, because circumstances and site conditions may change over the life of an OGF and OGL or the identity and financial responsibility of operators or the status of permits vary, a review of permits to be transferred is necessary as is a review of the initially approved reclamation plan prior to the final reclamation phase.  Both types of review by the director are subject to the call-up procedures described in paragraph 90-4.II.E.
E.
Expiration of permit after final reclamation. A permit shall expire upon the completion of final reclamation of the permitted OGF or OGL and final inspection by the
ECMC
and the county.
II.
Procedures.
A.
Interaction with ECMC permitting process. Many oil and gas development activities that require a land use permit from the county will also require a permit or other approval from the ECMC. In those cases, the county has a general preference for concurrent application for, and review of, the ECMC and county permits. A concurrent review may assist all involved parties in benefitting from the expertise, processes, and experiences of the other parties. To this end, applications for county land use permits pursuant to this chapter 90 will often require certain ECMC application materials as submittal requirements for the county land use permit. This ensures that the applicant has already prepared and submitted those materials to the ECMC before or concurrently with its submission to the county. Although the county’s submittal requirements require applying to the ECMC first, the county encourages applicants to begin the county’s pre-application process before submitting final materials to ECMC. Notwithstanding any recommended timeframe for processing applications, the director may pause the processing and review of an application for a county land use permit until a final decision by the ECMC or the ECMC director, when the director determines that such decision related to the ECMC’s process will assist the decision-making body for the county’s land use permit. This may mean that some applications that begin concurrently will not be finally resolved by the county until after the ECMC process has concluded. In no event does this code require the CDD to accept an application, deem an application complete, or present an application to a county decision-making body for final decision if the director concludes that the development that is the subject of the county land use permit application is subject to a review, approval, or permitting process by the ECMC for which the applicant has not already submitted a completed application to the ECMC.
B.
Interaction with federal permitting and/or NEPA processes. Some oil and gas development activities that require a land use permit from the county may also require, or be integrally related to, a permit or other approval from a federal agency. In those cases, the county has a general preference for concurrent application for, and review of, the federal agency and county permits. A concurrent review may assist all involved parties in benefitting from the expertise, processes, and experiences of the other parties. To this end, applications for county land use permits pursuant to this chapter 90 may require certain federal agency application materials, reports, or decisions (such as a final decision related to a NEPA process) as submittal requirements for the county land use permit. This ensures that the applicant has already prepared and submitted those materials to the federal agency before or concurrently with its submission to the county. Although the county’s submittal requirements require applying to, or otherwise engaging with, the appropriate federal agency first, the county encourages applicants to begin the county’s pre-application process before submitting final materials to the federal agency. Notwithstanding any recommended timeframe for processing applications, the director may pause the processing and review of an application for a county land use permit until a final decision by the federal agency, when the director determines that such decision related to the federal agency’s process will assist the decision-making body for the county’s land use permit. This may mean that some applications that begin concurrently will not be finally resolved by the county until after the applicable federal process has concluded. In no event does this code require the CDD to accept an application, deem an application complete, or present an application to a county decision-making body for final decision if the director concludes that the development that is the subject of the county land use permit application is subject to, or otherwise integrally related to or affected by, a review, approval, or permitting process by a federal agency for which the applicant has not already completed the applicable process with the federal agency.
C.
Summary of minor oil and gas permit application procedures. A minor oil and gas permit application is, and shall be processed as, a type of administrative land use permit pursuant to chapter 66, subject to the following more particular requirements:
1.
Notwithstanding subparagraph 66-11.II.A.1, the pre-submittal review of a proposed application submittal for a minor oil and gas permit shall not exceed fifteen (15) business days without the applicant’s consent.
2.
Staff’s compliance review of a minor oil and gas permit application may include a field inspection of the proposed site.
3.
At the request of the director, applicant, surface owner, or a surrounding landowner receiving notice pursuant to subsection 66-14.IV, the CDD may, at the discretion of the director and upon at least ten (10) days advance written notice to the surface owner of the proposed site, conduct a public site visit to evaluate the location, compliance with the code, and avoidance or mitigation that may be required for the proposed development. When possible, this site visit will be coordinated with site visits required by other governmental agencies. If the director determines that a public site visit is appropriate, such public site visit shall be conducted as part of a neighborhood meeting in general conformance with subsection 66-11.IV. When other governmental agencies are involved in the public site visit, the director may waive portions of subsection 66-11.IV as the director deems appropriate to facilitate the coordination with other governmental agencies. In no event is the county required to facilitate a public site visit.

D.
Summary of major oil and gas permit application procedures. A major oil and gas permit application is, and shall be processed as, a type of major land use permit pursuant to chapter 66, subject to the following more particular requirements:
1.
No sketch plan is required for a major oil and gas permit. An application for a preliminary plan can be the first county application with respect to a major oil and gas permit.
2.
Notwithstanding subparagraph 66-11.II.A.1, the pre-submittal review of a proposed application submittal for a major oil and gas permit shall not exceed fifteen (15) business days without the applicant’s consent.
3.
Staff’s compliance review of a major oil and gas permit application may include a field inspection of the proposed site.
4.
At the request of the director, applicant, surface owner, or a surrounding landowner receiving notice pursuant to subsection 66-14.IV, the CDD may, at the discretion of the director and upon at least ten (10) days advance written notice to the surface owner of the proposed site, conduct a public site visit to evaluate the location, compliance with the code, and avoidance or mitigation that may be required for the proposed development. When possible, this site visit will be coordinated with site visits required by other governmental agencies. If the director determines that a public site visit is appropriate, such public site visit shall be conducted as part of a neighborhood meeting in general conformance with subsection 66-11.IV. When other governmental agencies are involved in the public site visit, the director may waive portions of subsection 66-11.IV as the director deems appropriate to facilitate the coordination with other governmental agencies. In no event is the county required to facilitate a public site visit.
5.
Prior to consideration by the board pursuant to sections 66-7 and 66-21, the
PC
shall hold a public meeting and, at the close of the public meeting, act to recommend that the board approve, approve with conditions or deny the application pursuant to section 66-12.
Figure 90-4 B: Summary of Major Oil and Gas Permit Procedures
E.
Summary of subsequent review process subject to call-up.
1.
Final reclamation review.  Every operator that performs final reclamation on an OGL after the effective date of this chapter shall provide the CDD the information set forth in section 90-7 as part of the review and shall be subject to the procedures set forth in paragraph 90-4.II.E if modification to the final reclamation plan is desired or necessary.  A written request for final reclamation review containing the information required by section 90-7 shall be submitted to the CDD no more than one hundred eighty (180) days but not less than ninety (90) days prior to an operator’s commencement of final reclamation.
a.
No modifications, including compensation to the surface owner in lieu of completion of reclamation requirements, shall be approved unless they are at least as protective as the original final reclamation requirements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the director may approve, or approve with conditions, a final reclamation plan that proposes to leave all or part of the working pad surface or access road to the OGL unreclaimed if all the conditions set forth in paragraph 90-10.IX.D are met.
b.
Existing permits with approved plans.  For permits approved prior to the effective date of this chapter and which contained an approved final reclamation plan, the operator shall submit the information and materials required by section 90-7 along with a written certification that the plans for reclamation have not been changed since the final reclamation plan was approved with the permit.
c.
Existing permits with no approved plans. For permits approved prior to the effective date of this chapter which did not contain an approved final reclamation plan and no reclamation plan or associated financial assurance have been approved and provided pursuant to paragraph 90-14.I., the operator shall submit the information and materials required by section 90-7. The proposed final reclamation plan shall be reviewed and required, to the maximum extent practicable, to comply with the then current standards, rules and processes duly adopted by the ECMC and the county. The director shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed final reclamation plan as well as determine the amount of the financial assurance necessary to adequately address the scope of the final reclamation.
d.
Existing permits seeking modifications to an approved plan. For permits approved prior to the effective date of this chapter which contained a final reclamation plan to which the operator and surface owner now desire modifications, the operator shall submit the information and materials required by section 90-7 and identify the proposed modifications in detail.  The director shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed revisions to the final reclamation plan as well as determine the revised amount of the financial assurance necessary to adequately address the scope of the final reclamation, as modified. If modifications are requested, modifications shall be reviewed and required, to the maximum extent practicable, to comply with the then current standards, rules and processes duly adopted by the ECMC and the county.
e.
Permits approved after effective date.  All permits approved after the effective date of this chapter shall include a proposed final reclamation plan. At the time of final reclamation, if the operator is not requesting modifications to the approved final reclamation plan, the operator shall submit the information and materials required by section 90-7 along with a written certification that the plans for reclamation have not been changed since the final reclamation plan was approved with the permit. If the operator and surface owner desire modifications to the final reclamation plan approved with the permit, or if the director deems modifications to the permit’s final reclamation plan to be necessary to protect the public, such modifications shall be reviewed and required, to the maximum extent practicable, to comply with the then current standards, rules and processes duly adopted by the ECMC and the county. If the director determines the amount of the financial assurance is inadequate to address the scope of final reclamation including adjustments due to inflation, the director may require the financial assurance be increased.
f.
Final reclamation inspections.  A written request for final reclamation inspection shall be submitted to the CDD simultaneous with the operator’s submission to the ECMC of a Sundry Notice 4 describing final reclamation procedures or Form 6 Notice of Intent to Abandon indicating that the OGL meets reclamation requirements and objectives and is ready for inspection.  Upon receipt of the notice, the CDD may inspect the OGL to ensure full compliance and release of applicable financial assurances, rely on the inspections performed by ECMC staff and/or require a statement on behalf of a principal of the operator issued under the penalty of perjury that final reclamation has been fully and properly completed, is substantially free of defects in materials and workmanship and will be maintained as and to the extent required.  No final reclamation inspection shall be completed until such time as the operator has successfully completed the final reclamation review, and associated processes, if any, required by sections 90-4.II.E and 90-7. Final reclamation shall not be judged successful and complete sooner than all of the following have occurred: two (2) years after compliance with the applicable final reclamation plan and standards; the director or
LGD
complete the tasks and final reclamation inspection required of the ECMC director under ECMC Rule 1004; and, to the maximum extent feasible, a self-sustaining,  native (or otherwise approved) plant community is established at the OGL, with a density sufficient to control erosion and non-native plant invasion and to reestablish wildlife habitat or forage production.  The OGL must be free of state and county listed noxious weeds, oil field debris, contaminated soil and equipment.
Figure 90-4 C: Summary of Final Reclamation Review
2.
Transfer of permits.  New and existing permits issued by the county may be transferred or assigned to another operator only with the written consent of the director or, if the director’s decision is called-up, the board.  All conditions of approval will survive a change in ownership and apply to the operator’s successors and assigns, including financial assurances. The operator shall remain responsible for compliance with all conditions of approval related to the permit(s) and compliance with this code, including the obligation for financial assurances, until such time as the transfer is approved by the director or the board, in the event of a call-up.
​​​​​​The operator shall notify the CDD about the proposed assignment by providing ECMC Form 9, Transfer of Operatorship – Intent at least thirty (30) days, or as soon as practicable, before the anticipated transfer or assignment date. If the proposed transfer or assignment is subject to a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement between the operator and the transferee, the operator will indicate such on the Form 9 and the director will keep the Form 9 and any other associated information confidential pursuant to C.R.S. § 24-72-204(3)(a)(IV) until the Form 9, Transfer of Operatorship - Subsequent is filed.  The Form 9, Transfer of Operatorship – Subsequent shall be filed with the CDD at the same time of filing with the ECMC.  If necessary to make a decision, the director may request from the operator or the transferee any other form of material described in the submittal portions of this chapter.  The director will make a final determination to approve, approve with conditions, or deny a request to transfer a county permit within thirty (30) days after receiving all submittal items required under this subparagraph 90-4.II.E.2. The director may consent to a transfer or an assignment of a permit only if:
a.
The transferee demonstrates the financial and operational capability to comply with all requirements, terms and conditions of any applicable provisions of a MOU between the county and the operator, this chapter, the terms and conditions of the permit to be assigned and all applicable local, state, tribal and federal laws, rules and regulations.  The transferee shall deliver to the county an acknowledgement that it assumes responsibility for compliance with this code, all terms and conditions of the transferred permits and applicable MOUs with the county.
b.
The transferee delivers to the county certificates of insurance in the amounts and according to the terms required under this chapter.
c.
The transferee delivers, in form and content satisfactory to the county, substitute financial assurances in equivalent amounts as those previously associated with the permit, provided however, if the director determines the amount of the financial assurance is inadequate to address the scope of final reclamation, the director may require the substitute financial assurance be adjusted for inflation or otherwise increased due to increased costs associated with reclamation.
d.
The operator and the transferee submit to the county a written document, in a form satisfactory to the county and binding upon both the operator and transferee, detailing and verifying responsibility for remedying any existing or previously unresolved noncompliance issues and the timeframe in which such issues shall be resolved.  The director may withhold consent to assignment of the permit until all such matters are satisfactorily resolved.
e.
The operator and the transferee deliver an assignment or partial assignment of applicable terms of any MOU between the county and the operator.
f.
The adopted fee, if any is legislatively adopted by the board, for review of the transfer is remitted.
g.
Prior to approving the transfer, the director shall prepare a report for the board that demonstrates compliance with the approval criteria stated in this section and the director’s final determination on the transferability of the permit.
Figure 90-4 D: Summary of Permit Transfer Review
3.
Call-up procedure.  The decision made by the director in both types of review shall be subject to a call-up meeting before the board.  Within eight (8) days following the date of the director’s decision, the following parties may request review of the director’s decision by submitting a written call-up request to the director:
a.
In the case of a review of a proposed transfer, any individual county commissioner, the transferring operator, or the transferee, or;
b.
In the case of a review of final reclamation, any individual county commissioner, the operator, surface owner, surrounding landowner or commenting agency.
Within twenty (20) days following receipt of a request for a call-up meeting, the director shall schedule a public meeting for review by the board.  Prior to the call-up meeting, the director shall prepare a report for the board that demonstrates compliance with the applicable criteria.  The call-up meeting shall be noticed pursuant to subsection 66-14.IV and shall be a de novo review by the board subject to the same criteria and standards originally applicable to the director’s decision.
F.

Sec. 90-10 Standards applicable to all oil and gas development
I.
Need for the project.
The applicant shall demonstrate a need for the oil and gas operation, in the location proposed, to serve the applicant’s existing and projected oil and gas development, production and operational requirements.  The decision-making body may consider, among other things, other existing/proposed facilities that perform the same or related function, market trends that form the basis of demand for projections justifying the project, the degree to which the applicant’s projected oil and gas development justifying the current project are speculative or contingent on factors outside the applicant’s control, alternatives to the project that were considered but rejected by the applicant and whether the project is the best alternative based on need, technology, cost, cumulative impacts and these regulations.
II.
Protection of surface quality.
A.
Geologic and natural hazards.  No
OGF
or
OGL
shall be in a
geologic hazard area
or an area with slopes exceeding thirty percent (30%).  No OGF or OGL shall expose persons (including emergency personnel or neighboring properties) to significant and unmitigated dangers or risk, caused or intensified by adverse natural conditions in a known geologic hazard area, whether on-site or off-site or be designed in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the resources of the county.  If an existing OGL or OGF seeking a change is in a geologic hazard area, if applicable, in addition to all other information submitted to the ECMC in the required geologic hazard plan, the director may require the submittal of relevant information or mitigation measures described in section 70-8.  The applicant shall also identify how it will avoid the creation or an increase in the severity of adverse impacts on adjacent properties, including roadways, because of the OGL.  If the OGL is in an area prone to flood hazards, the applicant shall comply with chapter 78.
B.
Minimization of surface disturbance. Use of existing infrastructure and rights-of-way.
1.
Spacing.  The total number of well pads in any single six hundred forty (640) acre government section of
real property
shall not exceed four (4) unless the county agrees to a number more than four (4) pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the county and an operator.  Use of a memorandum of understanding may be appropriate where use of only four (4) well pads per governmental section is rendered impractical due to:
a.
Creation or existence of unavoidable direct, indirect, and cumulative adverse impacts to public health, safety, welfare, the environment or wildlife resources from oil and gas operations.
b.
The location of utilities or similar services.
c.
Demonstratively insurmountable technical issues related to the development or management of the mineral resource.
d.
Demonstrable safety concerns.
2.
Land disturbance.  To avoid the unreasonable loss of agricultural land, minimize land disturbances and facilitate future reclamation, OGLs, OGFs, other facilities and pipelines, and access roads shall be located, sized, constructed, and maintained to reasonably control dust and minimize weeds, erosion, alteration of natural features, removal of surface materials, and degradation due to contamination or pollution.
3.
Consolidation.  To the
maximum extent practicable
, operators shall consolidate OGLs, OGFs and pipeline rights-of-way to mitigate cumulative impacts to loss of agricultural land and wildlife resources, including fragmentation of agricultural land and wildlife habitat.
4.
Existing infrastructure.  Existing utility easements, roads and well pads shall be used to the maximum extent practicable to avoid erosion and minimize the land area devoted to oil and gas operations. Roadbeds shall be engineered to avoid or minimize impacts to riparian areas or wetlands to the maximum extent practicable. Road crossings of streams shall be designed and constructed to allow the passage of aquatic life, where practicable and appropriate. To the maximum extent feasible, operators shall share access roads and easements in developing a field and roads shall be routed to complement other land usage.  The county recognizes that in some instances an existing OGL or OGF which initially met the setback requirements of this code may not currently meet the requirements due to (a) the encroachment of other development into the setback area, (b) the OGL or OGF is a
nonconforming use
due to a failure to meet current setback requirements, or (c) because a waiver previously was obtained.  In those instances where the setback requirements of this code cannot be met currently, the use of the existing OGL or OGF may be considered for siting of a new OGF, provided that the placement of any new well, new or expanded working pad surface, or other new or expanded structure does not reduce any already nonconforming setback nor create any new nonconformity or violation of this code.
C.
Setbacks.  The county requires setbacks that, at a minimum, comply with the applicable setbacks set forth in ECMC rules, including without limitation Rule 604. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the county also establishes the following minimum requirements that are in addition to the setbacks established by ECMC rules:
1.
​​​​​
Informed consent. For purposes of this code and ECMC Rule 604 which allows some owners and tenants to consent to a lesser distance if such consent is based upon informed consent, the term “informed consent” shall have the meaning set forth in this chapter.
2.
Setbacks between any working pad surface and a property line are as follows:
a.
The required minimum setback shall be three hundred (300) feet if the adjacent parcel that shares the property line exclusively contains any one or more of the following: a commercial building, industrial building, public or private playgrounds, parks, permanent recreational fields or similar places of public assembly or community spaces.
b.
The required minimum setback shall be four hundred (400) feet if the adjacent parcel that shares the property line contains any dwelling unit or high occupancy building unit.
c.
If all owners and tenants of the adjacent parcel agree through informed consent to the proposed OGL, the setback distance from the property line may be reduced to a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet.
3.
Setbacks between any working pad surface and a commercial building or industrial building shall be no less than five hundred (500) feet, but may be increased based on a site-specific analysis of the OGL or OGF review criteria in paragraph 90-10.II.F.  However, if all building owners and tenants of the subject commercial or industrial building(s) agree through informed consent to the proposed OGL, the setback may be reduced to a minimum of three hundred (300) feet.
4.
In determining whether a setback less than two thousand (2,000) feet from a residential building unit or high occupancy building unit is appropriate, the decision-making body shall conduct a site-specific analysis of the proposed OGL's or OGF's compliance with the standards of this code, including without limitation the siting criteria in paragraph 90-10.II.F. However, if all building owners and tenants of the subject residential building unit(s) and high occupancy building unit(s) agree through informed consent to the proposed OGL, the setback may be reduced to a minimum of four hundred (400) feet.
5.
Flowlines and pipelines.   All flowlines and pipelines shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet from residential building units, high occupancy building units, and commercial and industrial buildings. The setback distance shall be measured from the nearest edge of the flowline or the pipeline. The director may require an applicant to provide a risk-based engineering study for all or part of its proposed flowline or pipeline right-of-way and may require the application of more stringent construction or operation standards or greater setbacks.  If required, a risk-based engineering study must, at a minimum, consider the risks posed by the flowline(s) and pipeline(s) in light of contents, size, and pressure.
6.
Reciprocal setbacks from existing well sites, flowlines and pipelines.  Regulations relating to reciprocal setbacks from existing well sites and from pipelines and flowlines are set forth in section 70-6.

Compliance with 1000-Series rules.  Notwithstanding a contrary determination by the ECMC or agreement with the surface owner regarding topsoil protection and reclamation, the county may require compliance with ECMC Rules 1002, 1003 or 1004 if the decision-making body determines compliance with such rules is reasonable to protect the public health, safety and welfare, including prevention of adverse impacts.
C.
Grant of extensions.  In any instance where consent of the ECMC director is required for an extension to complete reclamation, consent of the director shall also be required and notice of the request for extension shall be given by the operator to the director at the same time as that provided to the ECMC director.
D.
Working pad surface and road reclamation.  During interim reclamation, portions of the working pad surface no longer needed for permanent production operations and access roads not needed for vehicle travel shall be reclaimed.  To the maximum extent practicable, cut slopes, fills slopes and borrow ditches shall be covered with topsoil and revegetated to restore habitat, forage, scenic resources and to reduce soil erosion and maintenance costs.  At abandonment, the working pad surface and access roads must be reclaimed by the operator unless each of the following exists:
1.
The working pad surface or access is suitable for an existing post-reclamation use that is compliant with the code, including without limitation, maintaining compliance with any dust suppression requirements.
2.
If the access serves a residential use that is not otherwise exempt, the access has a valid county-issued driveway permit and, at the time of final reclamation, meets the applicable driveway standards set forth in section 74-8.
3.
If the working pad surface or access will be or is shared or used by more than one property owner, a legal mechanism exists for ongoing maintenance, (including without limitation maintaining compliance with any dust suppression requirements) after the operator has completed final reclamation and such mechanism is recorded in the county clerk’s real property records.
4.
The unreclaimed working pad surface or access road will not negatively contribute to sediment erosion or increase the potential for water contamination.
5.
The operator leaves all culverts and bridges in a condition that avoids plugging or collapse and erosion at inlets and outlets.
6.
The affected surface owner submits a written request to CDD that the working pad surface, access road, or certain parts thereof, be left unreclaimed and committing that the affected surface owner shall not engage in any excavation within the unreclaimed portions of any working pad surface that involves disturbing more than three (3) feet below the surface without first obtaining a county land use permit or building permit, as appropriate, for the same.
7.
The decision-making body finds that no net adverse impact to public health, safety, welfare, the environment, or wildlife resources will result from leaving the working pad surface or access road in place for the proposed post-reclamation use and approves or approves with conditions, a final reclamation plan detailing the unreclaimed working pad surface or access road.
In general, all working pad surfaces and spur access roads for which the sole purpose is facility access shall be reclaimed to match pre-existing adjacent topography, all culverts removed, and drainage crossings reclaimed to reduce potential long-term erosion or degradation.  Final reclamation includes recontouring the working pad surface and any road back to the original contour, seeding, controlling
noxious weeds
and may also include other techniques to improve reclamation success such as ripping, scarifying, replacing topsoil, constructing waterbars, pitting, mulching, redistributing woody debris and barricading. Seeds of native, perennial species or other plant materials must be used. If waterbars were used, they must be removed and seeded following successful revegetation.
E.
Erosion control.  Erosion control is generally sufficient when adequate ground cover is reestablished, water naturally infiltrates into the soil and gullying, headcutting, slumping and deep or excessive rilling is not observed.
F.
Abandonment in place.
1.
Protective measures to be considered when an OGF is proposed to be abandoned in place are:
a.
Minimal disruption to ongoing or future land use activities.  Land uses that are better suited to abandonment in place decisions include, but are not limited to, parks and natural areas, water crossings, flood irrigated fields or road crossings.
b.
Topsoil conservation for all areas disturbed during the abandonment process.
c.
Reclamation of all site access roads.
d.
An abandonment plan that addresses the potential for contamination or pollution associated with the abandonment activities and for monitoring and repairing facilities that may later become exposed.
2.
Piping less than thirty inches (30”) below grade shall be removed as part of final reclamation.
G.
Agricultural irrigation.  In agricultural areas, irrigation infrastructure shall be reestablished to meet the surface owner’s reasonably anticipated future agricultural production.
H.
Inspections.  The operator shall provide the CDD all final reports of plugging and abandonment. The operator shall pay the established inspection fee for each county visit to the site to perform an inspection of operator’s compliance with interim reclamation and final reclamation.
I.
Updated recordation.  As part of final reclamation of an OGF, the operator shall record in the county clerk’s real property records an updated site plan identifying all fully or partially removed OGF and all “as built” location data for any OGF that has been abandoned in place.  Recorded copies shall be provided to the director and surface owner(s) within sixty (60) days after final reclamation is complete.
J.
Fin
al reclamation shall not be judged successful and complete sooner than all of the following have occurred: two (2) years after compliance with this subsection;  the director or LGD completes the tasks and final reclamation inspection required of the ECMC director under ECMC Rule 1004; and a self-sustaining,  native (or otherwise approved) plant community is established at the OGL, with a density sufficient to control erosion and non-native plant invasion and to reestablish wildlife habitat or forage production.  The OGL must be free of state and county listed noxious weeds, oil field debris, contaminated soil and equipment.

I.
General requirements.
A.
Incorporation of
ECMC’
s minimum standards for flowlines. All flowlines shall comply with the minimum standards established by the ECMC for flowlines and crude oil transfer lines in ECMC’s flowline regulations (currently identified as the 1100 Series of Rules), as the same may be amended from time to time, including without limitation for: materials, design, installation, cover, top soil management, marking, inspection, maintenance, repair, operating requirements, corrosion control, record keeping, valves, integrity management, and abandonment, except a surface owner agreement allowing abandonment in place is necessary, but not sufficient, to support a request to abandon a pipeline in place.
B.
The decision-making body shall have discretion to grant or deny a request to abandon a pipeline in place based on all the factors identified in ECMC Rule 1105.d. All references to the ECMC’s director (such as submission of information to the director or decision to be made by the director) shall mean, for purposes of this section, the director. All references to the ECMC or commission shall mean, for purposes of this section, the decision-making body.
C.
Protective location.  All flowlines, off-location flowlines and pipelines transporting process materials, wastes, product and any other items used or generated by oil and gas operations shall, to the
maximum extent feasible
, be placed in the most protective location such as along property lines and shall be located to avoid existing building units; proposed building units as evidenced by a recorded plat, land use permit, building permit, or pending application for land use permit or building permit; surface waterbodies; designated open spaces; and designated outside activity areas.
D.
Boring.  To the maximum extent feasible, operators shall use boring technology when crossing streams, rivers, wetlands and irrigation ditches with a pipeline to minimize negative impacts to the channel, bank and
riparian areas
.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, open cuts may be used to cross irrigation ditches if the affected ditch company or owner approves of the technique.  All pipelines installed beneath a county road or public right-of-way shall be bored unless otherwise agreed to by the county engineer.
E.
Minimum depth.  The depth for all flowlines or pipelines buried within a county right-of-way or other public right-of-way shall be a minimum of six (6) feet below ground surface or the proposed roadway elevation, whichever is lower.  The depth for all pipelines outside of the county right-of-way shall be a minimum of thirty (30) inches, except on cropland all flowlines shall have a burial depth of no less than three (3) feet.
F.
Maintenance of existing vegetation.  During the construction phase, rather than scraping the surface, to the maximum extent practicable, the operator shall mow or brush hog vegetation to leave the root structure intact.
G.
Domestic taps.  The creation of new domestic taps is prohibited. The county encourages operators to decommission and remove existing domestic taps whenever and wherever possible.

Sec. 90-14 Financial assurances
Every operator of an
OGL
or
OGF
that is subject to the requirements of this chapter 90 shall provide the county with financial assurance in the types and amounts, subject to adjustments for inflation, required to comply with this section 90-14. It is the operator’s responsibility to ensure that financial assurance approved by the county remains in place at all times unless or until it is released by the county pursuant to subsection 90-14.VII or substitute financial assurance is approved pursuant to subsection 90-14.VI. The purpose of the county’s financial assurance is to protect the public health, safety, welfare, environment and wildlife resources in the county by ensuring that operators are capable of performing all of their obligations under this code and any applicable permit or approval issued by the county, including without limitation, ongoing mitigation of adverse impacts, operational and reporting requirements and duty to reclaim the surface of the site of an OGL or OGF at no cost to the county or public consistent with the requirements of this code and any applicable permit or approval issued by the county.
I.
Existing oil and gas operations.
Every operator of an OGL or OGF that lawfully exists as of the effective date of this chapter 90, or that is timely vested pursuant to a permit or approval issued by the county prior to the effective date of this new chapter 90, shall submit a financial assurance plan as part of the first annual report required by section 90-16. The financial assurance plan shall demonstrate how the operator proposes to comply with the financial assurance requirements of this section 90-14 with respect to each of the operator’s OGLs and OGFs within the county that is subject to the county’s jurisdiction. For purposes of the initial application to existing OGLs and OGFs, this section 90-14 shall be read to require an existing OGL or OGF to satisfy the county’s financial assurance requirements to the same extent as if the county were presently reviewing and permitting such OGL or OGF.
The director may request additional information or clarification that the director deems necessary to evaluate the proposed financial assurance and establish the appropriate financial assurance amount consistent with this section 90-14. If the director requests additional information, the operator shall submit such additional information to the director within ten (10) days of such request, unless a longer period is authorized by the director in writing.  The director shall issue a written determination of the required financial assurance. An operator shall provide the county with the required financial assurance within ninety (90) days of the director’s written determination establishing the required financial assurance.
If the financial assurance plan reveals that an OGL or OGF does not have a county approved final reclamation plan and associated financial assurance, the operator shall submit with its first annual report, a reclamation plan that contains the information set forth in subparagraph 90-5.I.R.  As to the financial assurance related to reclamation of an OGL or OGF lacking a final reclamation plan only, one extension of time up to six (6) months may be approved by the director for the submittal of a reclamation plan and its associated financial assurance if all the following are satisfied:​​​​​​
A.
A written request for the extension is submitted as part of the operator’s first annual report.
B.
The operator provides a written explanation for why the extension is warranted considering all relevant circumstances including, but not limited to, the number of OGL or OGF operated by the operator that do not have final reclamation plans, the availability of personnel or consultants to develop the necessary reclamation plan and anticipated complexity of the reclamation plan.
All other extensions of time to complete the final reclamation plan and provide the associated financial assurance must be approved by the board.
II.
New oil and gas operations.
Every permit or approval issued by the county pursuant to this chapter 90 includes, whether expressly identified as a condition of approval, a condition that the applicable required financial assurance must be provided to the county before any work subject to county permit or approval is performed.
III.
Types and amounts of required financial assurances.
A.
The financial assurance required by the county is equal to the cumulative total of the following categories of financial assurance, subject to any offset approved by the decision-making body pursuant to paragraph III.B below:
1.
County permit and code compliance.  Every permit or approval issued by the county pursuant to this chapter 90 includes a condition that financial assurance be provided to the county to protect it and the public from the risk of expenses to the county in the event the operator does not comply with ongoing applicable standards and conditions required by the county’s code, permit or approval during the lifetime of the OGL, OGF or other oil and gas operations within the county. Every operator operating or who initiates production at an OGL or OGF within the county shall provide a county-wide blanket financial assurance to the county in an amount of at least one hundred seventy-five thousand (175,000) dollars.
2.
Construction phase and completion phase impacts.  Every permit or approval issued by the county that contemplates the use of county roads for heavy equipment to access the site during the construction phase or completion phase includes a condition that financial assurance be provided to the county in an amount of at least five thousand (5,000) dollars.  The county’s financial assurance for construction phase and completion phase impacts is intended to protect the county from the risk of damages to county roads, bridges, other infrastructure from the use of heavy equipment and violations of the county’s standards and conditions related to such construction phase and completion phase activities.  The portion of financial assurance attributable to construction phase and completion phase impacts is subject to release by the county pursuant to subsection 90-14.VII following satisfactory completion of all construction phases and completion phases of the approved OGL, OGF, or other permit or approval.
3.
Interim reclamation.  Every permit or approval issued by the county that requires interim reclamation includes a condition that financial assurance be provided to the county in an amount equal to at least one hundred fifteen (115) percent of the estimated costs of performing such interim reclamation as documented by the operator and approved by the decision-making body.  The county’s financial assurance for interim reclamation is intended to protect the county from the risk of expenses incurred by the county to perform the required interim reclamation work in a manner required by the county’s code, permit or approval as well as expenses resulting from any violations of the county’s standards and conditions related to such interim reclamation.  The portion of financial assurance attributable to interim reclamation is subject to release by the county pursuant to subsection 90-14.VII following satisfactory completion of such interim reclamation requirements. Interim reclamation shall not be judged successful and complete sooner than all of the following have occurred: two (2) years after compliance with the applicable final reclamation plan and standards; submission of a Form 4 interim reclamation completion notice to the
CDD
that satisfies all requirements of
ECMC
Rule 1003.e.(3); the director or
LGD
complete or waive an interim reclamation inspection to confirm the description and photographs submitted with the Form 4; and a self-sustaining, native (or otherwise approved) plant community is established at the OGL, with a density sufficient to control erosion and non-native plant invasion and to reestablish wildlife habitat or forage production.
4.
Final reclamation.  Every permit or approval issued by the county that requires final reclamation includes a condition that financial assurance be provided to the county in an amount equal to at least one hundred fifteen (115) percent of the estimated costs of performing such final reclamation as documented by the operator and approved by the decision-making body.
5.
Case-by-case adjustment.  The amounts above represent minimum requirements. The decision-making body may increase the minimum required financial assurance on a case-by-case basis to fulfill the purposes of the financial assurance and considering the operator’s history of compliance. Other relevant factors may include, without limitation, the characteristics of the roads, bridges, and infrastructure at risk; the scope and complexity of the work to be performed; the number, type, and weight of equipment used; the time of year the operations are conducted; and whether county staff could step in to perform the work or whether independent contractors would be required to perform the work on the county’s behalf if the operator failed to complete the work.
B.
Offsets for financial assurances provided to other agencies.  In instances in which an operator has provided financial assurance to another government agency to ensure compliance with respect to the same OGL or OGF for which a county financial assurance is required, a prorated amount of such other financial assurance attributable to the OGL or OGF subject to county financial assurance may be used to offset the county’s financial assurance requirements.  The decision-making body reviewing the adequacy of the financial assurance shall have discretion to determine whether the other financial assurance satisfies the requirements of this code and to what extent, if any, such other financial assurance may offset the amounts required by this code.
C.
Access to financial assurance.  The entire amount of financial assurance held by the county (or held by another person or governmental entity for which an offset was approved) at any time is available to the county to ensure that all operations are conducted in a manner consistent with the standards of this code, permit or approval. In addition, the entire amount of financial assurance held by the county (or any portion held by another person or governmental entity for which an offset was approved) at any time is available to satisfy any fee, fine, penalty, or other remedy owed to the county pursuant to this code, and the county may draw upon the financial assurance to satisfy the same.  If the county draws upon financial assurance for any reason, it is the operator’s obligation to ensure the full amount of financial assurance remains to fulfill any ongoing obligations of the operator to the county, including a requirement to immediately replenish or replace any financial assurance spent by the county.
IV.
Acceptable forms of financial assurances.
An operator shall satisfy its financial assurance obligations to the county by using a cash bond, surety bond, letter of credit or escrow account, unless the ECMC, following a hearing, has approved another form of acceptable financial assurance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the county reserves the right to make a final determination of the acceptable form of county financial assurance, and in no event shall the county accept self-bonding. All forms of financial assurance must expressly acknowledge that the county may draw upon and thereafter spend the financial assurance immediately after written notice to the holder or issuer of the financial assurance that the requirements of subsection IX below have been satisfied.
V.
Periodic review and call-up.
A.
Periodic review.  All financial assurances required by this section 90-14 are subject to periodic review by the director. The director may review the adequacy of existing financial assurance at any time, but the director shall not require an increase in an existing financial assurance more than one time per calendar year; provided, however, that this limitation does not apply to increases to financial assurance as a result of a code enforcement matter or review of an operator’s request (such as a request for approval of substitute financial assurance pursuant to subsection 90-14.VI).  The factors considered by the director in evaluating whether financial assurance remains adequate shall include, without limitation, changes to the scope of operations, changes in the operator’s financial fitness, the operator’s recent history of compliance or noncompliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and inflation.  In considering whether inflation warrants adjustment to an operator’s financial assurance, the director shall rely on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for the Denver Core Based Statistical Area as the primary metric but may rely on other sources, as appropriate, including guidance issued by the ECMC director relative to implementation of ECMC Rule 707.a.(1).  In years when the director determines that an inflation adjustment is necessary, the adjustment should be applied as equally as possible to all operators.
B.
Call-up.  The following decisions are subject to the call-up procedures set forth in subparagraph 90-4.II.E.3:
1.
An initial determination of required financial assurance by the director; and
2.
A change to an existing financial assurance required by the director because of a periodic review.
VI.
Substitution; process; timing.
A.
Submittals. An operator may request a substitution of existing financial assurance by submitting the following to the director:
1.
A narrative explaining the details of the date originally approved, amount, form, and conditions of the existing financial assurance; the proposed new amount, form, and conditions of financial assurance; and the reasons for the request.
2.
A copy of the existing financial assurance.
3.
A copy of any permit and conditions of approval secured by the financial assurance.
4.
A draft of the proposed new financial assurance.
5.
If the amount of financial assurance is based on a cost estimate (such as an estimate for interim reclamation costs or final reclamation costs) that is more than two (2) years old, an updated cost estimate.
6.
If the proposed new financial assurance is not a cash or surety bond, evidence that the ECMC has conducted a hearing and approved the new financial assurance form.
7.
If the operator’s last annual report submitted pursuant to section 90-16 was submitted more than three (3) months before the request to substitute financial assurance, an updated annual report that satisfies the requirements of section 90-16.
8.
A written certification that no event-based reports or notices required by section 90-17 are due to the county.
9.
A draft letter, form of release, or other necessary documentation required to release the existing financial assurance, including instructions on the delivery of the same.
B.
Review. The director shall review the proposed new financial assurance for compliance with all requirements of this section as if the director were conducting a periodic review to determine the adequacy of the financial assurance pursuant to subsection 90-14.V.
C.
Process; timing.  Within thirty (30) days of receiving all the submittals required by paragraph VI.A above, the director will notify the operator of a final decision with respect to the request or identify additional information needed to evaluate the request. The director shall not unreasonably withhold approval of the proposed new financial assurance so long as the proposed new financial assurance satisfies all standards imposed by this section 90-14 and the existing financial assurance remains in place until the new financial assurance becomes effective.
VII.
Conditions for release of financial assurance.
A.
Submittals. An operator may request release of financial assurance by submitting the following to the director:
1.
A narrative explanation of the details of the date originally approved, amount, form, and conditions of the existing financial assurance; what performance obligations or conditions it secures and a certification by the operator of the status of each such obligation or condition, including relevant dates and supporting evidence such as photographs and inspection reports demonstrating that particular work has been performed and meets applicable standards; and the reasons for the request.
2.
A copy of the existing financial assurance.
3.
A copy of any permit and conditions of approval secured by the financial assurance.
4.
If the operator’s last annual report submitted pursuant to section 90-16 was submitted more than three (3) months before the request to release financial assurance, an updated annual report that satisfies the requirements of section 90-16.
5.
A written certification that no event-based reports required by section 90-17 are due to the county.
6.
A draft letter, form of release, or other necessary documentation required to release the existing financial assurance, including instructions on the delivery of the same.
B.
Review; standards.  The county shall not release a financial assurance until all relevant performance obligations and conditions secured by the financial assurance have been satisfied, unless an adequate substitution of financial assurance is reviewed and approved pursuant to subsection 90-14.VI or the county permit is being surrendered before any work requiring reclamation has been performed.  As a condition of release, an operator shall relinquish the permit, approval, or portion thereof related to any financial assurance that is released by the county and such permit may no longer be relied upon by the operator to perform any work or other development activities for which a permit, approval, or financial assurance is required.
C.
Process; timing.  Within forty-five (45) days of receiving all the submittals required by paragraph VII.A above, the director will notify the operator of a final decision with respect to the request or identify additional information needed to evaluate the request. The director shall not unreasonably withhold or delay approval of the release of financial assurance so long as all obligations and conditions secured by the financial assurance have been satisfied.
VIII.
Cancellation of financial assurance.
All forms of financial assurance accepted by the county shall include a requirement that they cannot be cancelled or non-renewed without at least thirty (30) days advance written notice to the operator and the county, evidenced by receipt, except when such financial assurance is being cancelled for nonpayment by the operator in which case ten (10) days advance written notice is required.  Language relating to cancellation requirements stating that the issuer or holder is limited to “endeavor to” provide such notice is not acceptable. In addition, the terms of the financial assurance shall require the issuer or holder to provide written notice to the county within five (5) business days of disbursing all or a portion of the financial assurance to any party other than the county.
IX.
Forfeiture of financial assurance.
Upon finding by the board pursuant to this subsection that an operator is out of compliance with this code, or a permit or approval issued by the county, the board shall declare the operator in default. Such declaration shall be in the form of a motion at a meeting of which the applicant has been notified at least ten (10) days prior to such meeting.  After finding an applicant in default, the board shall take one (1) or more of the following actions:
A.
Access the financial assurance. The board may access the financial assurance to bring the operator or site into compliance, including satisfying any damages, penalties, fines, or other financial obligations owed to the county. If performance of work is required, the work may be completed using county resources or may be contracted out to a private firm.
B.
Temporary suspension or permanent revocation. The board may temporarily suspend or permanently revoke a county approval or permit.
C.
Assess fines. The board may directly assess fines or direct the director to assess fines pursuant to section 90-18.
D.
Use of proceeds. The board may contract with any person (including without limitation any subsequent operator who has acquired the oil and gas operation, OGF, or OGL by purchase, foreclosure or otherwise) who is willing to covenant to perform the work necessary to bring the subject oil and gas operation(s), OGF(s), or OGL(s) into compliance.  If the board enters such a contract to have work performed, the board may assign proceeds or its right to receive proceeds, if any, collected under a financial assurance to the contracting party for use of the proceeds to perform the work required to come into compliance. The agreement to assign proceeds, if any, shall only be made after the work plan has been reviewed and approved by the board and after additional adequate financial assurance, if any, has been provided by the contracting party in accordance with the standards of this code. If the contracting party is a subsequent operator of noncompliant oil and gas operation(s), OGL(s), or OGF(s) that require corrective work to come into compliance with this code, such subsequent operator’s obligation to complete work or otherwise come into compliance pursuant to an agreement under this section shall not be affected by the failure of the county to collect proceeds under the financial assurance if the county makes a
good faith
effort to obtain such proceeds.
E.
Pursue operator. The amount of the financial assurance is not a cap on the recovery to which the county is entitled. If the financial assurance is not sufficient to cover the costs of work, fines, damages, other expenses or other remedies available to the county, the county retains all other enforcement options available by law. The board may sue the operator for specific performance or recovery of any amount necessary to cure the default over and above the amount available under the financial assurance.
F.
Pursue any other remedy available by law. The board may authorize the county attorney’s office to review and pursue any other remedy available by law.

Sec. 90-15 Insurance
Each operator shall comply with these insurance standards to protect human health and safety, prevent damage to property, prevent unacceptable losses to public finances and prevent unreasonable interference with the public welfare. The director, with notice and consent of the county finance director and risk manager, may waive or alter requirements below if the operator can demonstrate that required coverage is not commercially available or not relevant to the operations proposed in the application. Where an operator owns, holds or controls fifty (50) percent or more of another operator doing business within the county, the parent company operator may fulfill the obligations of this section for itself and its subsidiary operator companies, provided the policy(ies) name both the parent and the subsidiary operator companies and provide coverage in the required amounts for each entity the parent operator seeks to cover. Operators shall maintain or cause to be maintained the following types of insurance with insurers authorized by the state of Colorado and carrying a financial strength rating from A.M. Best of no less than A-VII (or similar rating from an equivalent recognized rating agency):
I.
Commercial general liability insurance.
Operator will maintain general liability coverage for property damage, bodily injury to third parties and sudden or accidental pollution that requires remediation with no exclusion for claims arising from operator-caused seismicity from oil and gas wells, in the minimum amount of five million (5,000,000) dollars per occurrence.  The coverage required by this section may be secured alone or in combination with an umbrella or excess policy.  The county shall be named as a “certificate holder” and “scheduled person or organization” so the county receives advance notice of cancellation.  Operators shall be responsible for any damage or loss suffered by the county because of noncompliance by the operator or any subcontractor with this section or the code.
II.
Cancellation; non-renewal.
All policies shall be endorsed such that they cannot be cancelled or non-renewed without at least thirty (30) days advance written notice to the operator and the county, evidenced by receipt, except when such policy is being cancelled for nonpayment of a premium in which case ten (10) days advance written notice is required. Language relating to cancellation requirements stating that the insurer’s notice obligation is limited to “endeavor to” is not acceptable.
III.
Right of contribution.
Operator shall ensure that each of the policies is endorsed to provide they are primary without right of contribution from the county or any insurance or self-insurance issued to the county.
IV.
Lapses.
In the event an operator’s coverage lapses, is canceled, or otherwise not in force, in addition to any other remedy set forth in chapter 80 or section 90-18, the county reserves the right to obtain the insurance required by this chapter and charge all costs and associated expenses to operator, which shall become due and payable immediately.

Sec. 90-16 Annual reporting requirements
Every operator who commences operation or initiates production at an
OGL
or
OGF
within the county after the effective date of this new chapter 90, shall submit an operator’s report required by this section within ninety (90) days after assuming responsibility for an existing OGL or OGF or receiving county approval for a new OGL or OGF.  If the information for an existing OGL or existing OGF is available in a current annual report filed by another operator, the new operator may reference the relevant information in the prior annual report but shall provide a letter addendum setting forth all information that has changed since the filing of the referenced annual report.  All operators of an existing OGL or OGF as of the effective date of this new chapter 90 shall file an initial annual report required by this section within thirty (30) days after the effective date. Thereafter, all operators of OGLs or OGFs doing business in the county shall file an annual report on or before April 30 of each year.
The annual report shall contain a certification from the operator’s chief executive officer or other authorized local representative that all information contained in the annual report is true to the best of their knowledge and that the report is made in
good faith
.  If requested, the permit holder shall cooperate fully with the county during any verification process, including access to supporting documentation regarding the nature and status of any information in the annual report.
If an operator believes any of the information to be provided in the annual report is confidential, such information shall be handled as described in ECMC Rule 223 with determinations being made under this section by the director. The report shall contain, but not be limited to, the following information for all OGLs and OGFs, unless plugged and abandoned, that are owned or operated by the operator in the unincorporated portions of the county:
I.
Contact information.
Identification of the operator’s preferred mailing address, email address(es), and phone number(s) for receiving communications from the county.
II.

Sec. 90-18 Violations and enforcement
I.
Applicability of Chapter 80.
This chapter shall be enforced in accordance with chapter 80 of the code except as follows:
A.
Inspections.  In addition to the entry and inspection rights set forth in section 80-4, the following entry and inspection provisions shall apply:
1.
Inspections by the county.  Inspections to ensure compliance will be coordinated with the operator to allow operator presence on site and to ensure the site visit is conducted in accordance with all applicable operator safety requirements. Inspections in response to odor, noise or possible violations of permit conditions, or these regulations, may occur as soon as feasible upon receipt of the complaint. Unless urgent circumstances exist, the county will use best efforts to give four (4) hours prior notice to the operator’s contact person at the telephone number on file. The county reserves the right to increase required inspections if an operator is found to be non-compliant.
2.
Any attempt to refuse entry to, impede, obstruct, delay, or in any manner interfere with a lawful inspection, shall constitute grounds for revocation of the permit in addition to any other penalties permitted by this code.
B.
Notice to correct violations.  The notice to correct violation under paragraph 80-5.I.A shall be sent by email to the most recent email address provided by the operator in an annual report as well as by certified mail, return receipt requested to the operator’s mailing address on file with the
CDD
. If no email or mailing address is on file with the CDD (such as in instances in which no county permit has been obtained), the notice to correct violation under paragraph 80-5.I.A may be sent by email to the most recent email address provided by the operator to the
ECMC
and by certified mail, return receipt requested to the operator’s or surface owner’s mailing address on file with the CDD, ECMC, or as listed in the records of the county assessor’s office. The operator shall respond to the notice to correct within forty-eight (48) hours and provide any proposed remedy or defense to the notice to correct.
C.
False or inaccurate information.  The provisions of section 80-7 shall similarly apply if any applicant for an oil and gas permit supplies false or inaccurate information to a decision-making body or new significant information is brought to the decision-making body’s attention at any point during the process or after the issuance of a permit.
D.
Sanctions and remedies.
1.
For purposes of sanctions and remedies under section 80-6, whenever a violation determination or stop order is issued for a violation that is related to protecting and minimizing
adverse impacts
to public health, safety, welfare, the environment and wildlife resources, the director may, but is not required, to issue a fine up to fifteen thousand (15,000) dollars for each violation and for each separate day.  Days of violation shall be calculated in the manner described in ECMC Rule 525.b.1 through 4.  In considering the appropriate fine, the director shall consider the following mitigating and aggravating factors:
a.
Whether the violation resulted in threatened or actual impact to public health, safety, welfare, the environment or wildlife resources and the degree to which it did so.
b.
Whether the violation threatened or impacted livestock, wildlife resources, aquatic resources, soil, crops, a water source, waters of the state or other environmental resources and the degree to which it did so.
c.
The degree of threatened or actual damage that occurred.
d.
The size of any leak, release or spill.
e.
The toxicity of the leak or spill.
f.
Whether any persons were harmed.
g.
The duration of the violation.
h.
Whether the same or similar violations have occurred at the location previously.
i.
Whether the operator has a history of violations of any applicable rules of similar or different types, at the location or others.
j.
The timeliness and adequacy of the operator’s correction actions.
k.
The degree the violation was outside the operator’s reasonable control and responsibility.
l.
Whether the operator acted with gross negligence or knowing and willful misconduct.
m.
Whether the operator self-reported and the nature and promptness of the response by the operator.
n.
Self-audits or compliance monitoring done by the operator.
o.
Whether the operator was cooperative with all agencies involved in working to mitigate the impacts of the violation.
2.
Payment of fines.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the director, an operator will pay the imposed fine by certified funds within thirty (30) days of the director’s notice of the imposition of the fine, unless the board grants a longer period under the appeal process or unless the operator files for judicial appeal, in which event payment of the fine will be stayed pending resolution of such appeal. An operator’s obligation to comply with this code, orders or permits will not be stayed pending resolution of an appeal, except by court order. If a fine is not timely paid or otherwise stayed pursuant to this subparagraph, the county may call upon the operator’s financial assurance to satisfy the fine and require that adequate financial assurance be replenished by a date certain.
3.
Appeal of fine.  The fine imposed by the director may be appealed according to the procedures described in subsection 80-5.IV and may also be combined with an appeal of a stop order or violation determination.  When considering the appropriateness of the fine, the board shall review the criteria set forth in subparagraph 90-18.I.D.1.
II.
Remedies cumulative.  The remedies set forth in sections 80-6, 90-14 and 90-18 shall be cumulative and shall in no way limit the director’s, board’s or county attorney’s authority to seek any other remedy available at law or equity for violations of this code.

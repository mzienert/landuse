ARTICLE II. DIRECTIONAL SIGNS AND BUSINESS PLAQUES
Sec. 98-11. Revocation and removal.
Failure to comply with standards. The
administrator
may
revoke a
directional sign
and
business plaque
permit
and remove the sign if he or she determines that the sign was altered so that it no longer meets the design or location requirements or if the administrator finds that the
permittee
no longer meets the eligibility requirements found in this chapter. The administrator
shall
provide written notice to the permittee if the permit is revoked.
Removal for
county
purposes. The county may remove any permitted directional sign and business plaque in the event the location of such sign is needed for
roadway
activities including, but not limited to,
construction
, and reconstruction or maintenance. If the county removes the directional sign and business plaque, it shall attempt to work with the permittee to find a substitute location. If a substitute location cannot be found, the permittee shall be entitled to an appropriate pro-rata rebate of that part of paid fees applicable to the unused remainder of the term.

Sec. 54-70. Authority and powers of the director of aviation.
The
director
of aviation
shall
have the authority to designate parking
control
zones within the boundaries of the Durango-La Plata
County
Airport.
The director of aviation is designated as the
chief
parking enforcement officer for the Durango-La Plata County Airport. The chief parking enforcement officer, along with any airport personnel designated parking enforcement officers by the chief parking enforcement officer, shall have the authority to enforce designated parking control zones on the Durango-La Plata County Airport
premises
and grounds through the issuance of a penalty assessment notice, as set forth in section
54-74
(Ord. No. 2014-1, § 3(Exh. A), 4-22-2014)
Effective on: 4/22/2014
Sec. 54-71. Owner liability for parking violations.
In
addition
to any other liability provided for in this article, the
owner
of a motor
vehicle
who is engaged in the business of leasing or renting motor vehicles is liable for payment of a parking
violation
fine unless the owner of the leased or rented motor vehicle can furnish sufficient evidence that the vehicle was, at the time of the parking violation, in the care, custody or
control
of another
person
. To avoid liability for payment, the owner of the motor vehicle is required, within a reasonable time after notification of the parking violation, to furnish the prosecutorial division of the appropriate
jurisdiction
, the name and address of the person or company who leased, rented or otherwise had the care, custody or control of such vehicle. As a condition to avoid liability for payment of a parking violation, any person or company who leases or rents motor vehicles to another person
shall
attach to the leasing or rental agreement a notice stating that, pursuant to the requirements of this section, the operator of the vehicle is liable for payment of a parking violation fine incurred when the operator has the care, custody or control of the motor vehicle. The notice shall inform the operator that the operator's name and address shall be furnished to the prosecutorial division of the appropriate jurisdiction when a parking violation fine is incurred by the operator.

violation
of this article in any zone designated and marked by official signs as a tow-away zone
may
be subject to towing and impoundment immediately upon being left unattended by the

shall
stop
,
stand
or
park
a
vehicle
in any manner in
violation
of the provisions contained on such signs except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic, or in compliance with the directions of a parking
control
officer, peace officer or official traffic control device.
II.
It is a violation to park on any part of the grounds and premises of the Durango-La Plata County Airport that is designated as a
snow route
so as to impede snow removal operations which are imminent or in progress.
III.
Any person who violates any designated parking control zones commits an offense as set forth in C.R.S. § 30-15-402, as amended, and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine as adopted by the
board
of county
commissioners
.
IV.
Whenever any vehicle is located in a designated tow-away zone, the parking enforcement officer

, if he deems such vehicle is in violation of such zone, cause such vehicle to be towed as follows:
A.

Sec. 54-74. Penalty assessment procedure.
I.
Penalty assessment notice. When a
person
is arrested for an offense as set forth in C.R.S. § 30-15-402, as amended, the parking enforcement officer
shall
issue the person a penalty assessment notice and release the person upon its terms. The penalty assessment notice, except as otherwise provided for in this section regarding illegally parked
vehicles
, shall be a summons and complaint containing identification of the alleged offender, specification of the offense and applicable fine, a requirement that the alleged offender pay the fine or appear to answer the charge at a specified time and place, and other matters reasonably adopted effectuating the purpose of this article.
II.
Acknowledgement or denial of guilt. If the person given a penalty assessment notice chooses to acknowledge his guilt, he
may
pay the specified fine in person, by mail or other available payment methods within the time specified in the notice. If he chooses not to acknowledge his guilt, the defendant shall appear as required in the notice. Upon trial, if the alleged offender is found guilty, the fine imposed shall be that specified in the notice for the offense of which he was found guilty along with any customary court costs, which shall be in
addition
to the fine.
III.
Notice on illegally parked vehicle. Whenever any motor vehicle without a driver is found parked or stopped in
violation
of any of the restrictions imposed by this article, the parking enforcement officer finding such vehicle shall take its license plate number and state of registration of the vehicle, and may take any other information displayed on the vehicle which may identify its user, and shall conspicuously affix to such vehicle a penalty assessment notice, which shall indicate the offense or infraction and direct the
owner or operator
of the vehicle to either remit the penalty assessment provided for by this article for the offense or infraction specified along with applicable fine, or to respond to and answer the charge against him at a place and at a time specified in the notice.
IV.
Failure to comply with notice on parked vehicle. If the driver or
owner
of a motor vehicle charged with an apparent violation of the restrictions on stopping, standing or parking under this article does not respond to a penalty assessment notice affixed to such vehicle, as provided for in this section, by paying the applicable fine either in person, by mail or other available payment methods within the time specified in the notice, the penalty assessment notice shall be transmitted to the clerk of the
county
court as a summons. The summons shall be set for a hearing in county court at the next regularly scheduled date on which the court handles such infractions. The driver or owner of the vehicle may then pay the fine set forth in the penalty assessment notice along with all applicable court costs or request to contest the penalty assessment notice. If the driver or owner of the unattended vehicle chooses to contest the penalty assessment, the court will set a date for the trial.
V.
Presumption in reference to illegal parking. In any prosecution charging a violation of any provision of this article governing the stopping, standing or parking of a vehicle, proof that the particular vehicle described in the complaint was parked in violation of this article, together with proof that the defendant named in the complaint was at the time of such parking the registered owner of such vehicle, shall constitute in evidence a prima facie presumption that the registered owner of such vehicle was the person who parked or placed such vehicle at the point where, and for the time during which, such violation occurred.

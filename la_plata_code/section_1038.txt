Chapter 70: General Site Development Standards Applicable to All Development
Overview
This code contains two (2) types of standards: prescriptive and performance based. Prescriptive standards require the applicant to satisfy criteria in a specific manner and ensure certainty, predictability and uniformity in the decision-making process. Because of their relevance to public health, safety and welfare, these standards oftentimes apply technical or quantitative measures and are strictly applied to each development. Some examples of prescriptive standards in this code are those pertaining to water, sewer, access, emergency services and regard for natural hazards. In exceptional circumstances, an applicant may seek relief from a prescriptive standard by obtaining a variance as described in section 66-27.
In contrast, a performance-based standard allows the applicant and the decision-making body greater flexibility to determine the way a performance goal is reached. The necessity of reaching the stated goal is not waived or varied but the means for accomplishing it may take account of distinguishing attributes of the project and the ability of the applicant to mitigate adverse impacts. For example, the compatibility analysis in section 70-5 is a performance-based standard that focuses on the effects of a proposed land use. Where the effects of a development are deemed undesirable, adverse or detrimental, this code allows the applicant to propose measures designed to mitigate those effects and thereby make the development compatible with the surrounding area or natural environment. Some common types of development constraints and forms of mitigation are described in Table 70-5.

Sec. 70-1 Applicability
Chapter 70 of this code contains the general site development standards that are applicable to all development in the unincorporated county, provided, however, oil and gas development is subject to the provisions of chapter 90 of this code, including select provisions of this chapter 70. The standards in this chapter cover a wide variety of subject areas, including building setbacks and height, buffers, protection of critical lands and scenic resources, open space and parks, road design and vehicle access, off-street parking, outdoor lighting, neighborhood protection, utilities and services, and signs. The general site development standards of this chapter work together with the supplemental overlay standards in chapter 72, standards for specific uses in chapter 73, and the road standards in chapter 74 to comprise the substantive standards governing new development in the county. These standards are applied at all stages of the development review process and the applicant shall demonstrate compliance with all applicable standards. Unless otherwise specifically addressed by a section of this code, the development standards set forth in this chapter 70 shall apply to all new development on the effective date of this code.

Sec. 70-2 Utilities and services
I.
Minimum required services.
This section, along with chapter 74, sets forth the minimum infrastructure standards to be satisfied by a proposed project. Except for temporary uses and other uses specifically exempted elsewhere in this code, all developments shall be required to demonstrate that adequate utilities and services, such as: water, wastewater treatment, electrical, telephone, internet, cable TV and fuel supplies, are available to serve the development.
II.
Utility installation and easements.
Utilities shall be placed within a county right-of-way or legally established easement and shall be free from conflicting legal encumbrances, avoid unnecessary excavations and be reasonably free from physical obstructions. Multiple use of a given easement is encouraged to minimize the number of easements burdening the real property. Where utility lines are to be provided to a development, these facilities shall be installed to the property line of each individual lot within the development. Electrical utilities may be installed to a central location.
A.
To the maximum extent practicable, utility lines shall be installed below ground. Except for residential lots larger than ten (10) acres, all utility lines serving new development shall be installed to meet minimum depth standards established by any applicable utility, ditch company or county/state road standards, but no less than two (2) feet minimum within a county road right-of-way. The applicable decision-making body may also allow utility lines to be placed above ground in areas where it is determined that existing utility infrastructure, safety, environmental degradation, destruction of wetlands, adverse impacts to cultural resources, or similar adverse impacts render it infeasible to place the utilities underground.
B.
Minimum clearance. A minimum ground clearance of eighteen (18) feet shall be provided where there are overhead utility lines that cross public roads and streets. The clearance shall be measured at the lowest point where the line crosses the traveled portion of the street.
C.
Notification and inspection. The applicant shall notify affected ditch companies prior to installation of utilities and shall obtain a permit from the public works director prior to the commencement of any utility installation projects in a county right-of-way. At the discretion of the public works director an inspection of the installation may be conducted to evaluate, among other things, densities, moisture content, resurfacing, and cleanup activities. An advance request for inspection shall be made in instances where the acceptability of materials used for backfill is questioned.
III.
Solid waste disposal.
Applicants shall demonstrate that adequate solid waste disposal sites and facilities will be provided within the development and the method in which solid waste will be collected from the development. Where common trash facilities are provided, these shall be screened, as specified in section 70-17, and shall be enough in number, size and design to prevent overflowing and access by animals.
IV.
Fire protection
. Except for administrative land use permits, applicants shall submit a fire response plan to the appropriate fire protection district and shall comply with the adopted fire code, as prescribed by the fire chief of the district. The fire response plan shall provide fire equipment access to each building or potential building on the proposed site, and shall indicate the available fire flow in gallons per minute, the amount of water storage available, any on-site firefighting equipment to be provided, and the response time anticipated during summer and winter months. The fire response plan shall meet the approval of the local fire chief.

Sec. 70-3 Sewage disposal
Applicants shall document sewage disposal for a development through one (1) of the means described in subsections I through III of this section:
I.
Connection to existing system
.
A.
Except for land uses specifically exempted elsewhere in this code, development located within four hundred (400) feet of an existing central sewer system shall connect to that system, unless the existing system's provider certifies the system lacks sufficient capacity to serve the proposed development, the connection would be technically impracticable, or the provider otherwise refuses to serve the proposed development. The distance from the proposed development to the applicable existing system shall be measured in a direct line from the nearest point on the development's property line to any main of the provider’s collection system.
B.
Binding commitment. At project submittal the applicant shall provide written confirmation from the existing sewer provider stating the provider has the physical and legal capacity to serve the development and is willing to provide sewer service sufficient for build-out of the proposed development, including all phases if multiple phases are contemplated. Prior to permit issuance or final plat recording, the applicant shall provide a binding commitment for service signed by the service provider (such as a perpetual, non-revocable tap reservation) or evidence of tap purchases from the service provider.
II.
Individual systems—approval required.
Individual, on-site wastewater treatment systems shall comply with the applicable standards adopted by LPCPH. Confirmation of conformance to the standards shall be provided by LPCPH prior to project approval. OWTS with design capacity less than or equal to two thousand (2,000) GPD, including all permits, performance, location, construction, alteration, installation and use must be reviewed and approved by LPCPH. OWTS with a design capacity greater than two thousand (2,000) GPD must be reviewed and approved by CDPHE including site location and design approval in conformance with C.R.S. § 25-8-702; and discharge permit requirements in conformance with the Water Quality Control Act, C.R.S. § 25-8-501
et seq.
III.
Common sewage disposal
. If a common sewage disposal system is proposed, all detailed plans and specifications for such system shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer.
A.
The plans shall be submitted to the CDPHE and/or LPCPH, whose approval shall be required before a new common sewage disposal system may be created. A copy of the easement and maintenance agreement approved by LPCPH shall also be provided to the county.
B.
The applicant shall provide written certification from the professional engineer of the adequacy and safety of the proposed system including, but not limited to: the adequacy of the proposed system in relation to the topography of the proposed development, the proposed population density, soil conditions, and watersheds located on or draining into or over the proposed development. The certification shall appear on both the final plat and the detailed plans and specifications of the planned sewage disposal system.
C.
Construction specifications for the proposed sewage disposal system shall comply with the applicable guidelines of the American Public Works Association, the regulations of CDPHE, and the county.
IV.
Future connections in urbanizing areas
. Developments located within a municipality’s adopted 3-mile planning area shall include utility easements along the development’s public road rights-of-way to provide the opportunity for future sewage service connections. The applicant shall consult with the municipality, or applicable municipal service provider, to determine the minimum width necessary for such easements, and their specific locations.

Sec. 70-4 Domestic water
I.
Purpose, authority, and applicability
.
A.
Purpose. Securing a reliable and safe water source for all
development
, while
mitigating
any impacts of new
development’s
water consumption on existing uses’ water supply, is necessary to protect the community’s health, safety, and welfare, and the continued viability of
residential
,
commercial
, and
industrial
development. These water quantity and quality standards, therefore, are intended to secure the continued availability of adequate,
potable water
to
development
within the county’s
unincorporated
territories.
B.
Authority. Article 20 of Title 29 and Title 30 of the Colorado Revised Statutes authorize the Board of County Commissioners to regulate the use of land in a manner that protects against adverse impacts on the community, surrounding areas, and the natural environment, consistent with constitutional rights. This authorization includes a delegation of authority to consider the impacts of development on the quantity and quality of the region’s water resources. These water quantity and quality standards are intended to protect the community’s water resources and their availability for existing and future uses and to operate parallel to and consistent with those regulations promulgated, and permits issued, by the Division of Water Resources pursuant to Title 37 of the Colorado Revised Statutes and Title 402 of the Colorado Code of Regulations.
C.
Applicability. These provisions apply to all development except for:
1.
Development not requiring a land use permit;
2.
Adjustments and plat modifications approved pursuant to section 66-5 which do not require a change to existing water supply or demand;
3.
Lot consolidations and boundary adjustments approved pursuant to section 66-5, which do not require a change to existing water supply or demand;
4.
Special events approved pursuant to section 66-5;
5.
Temporary uses approved pursuant to section 66-6;
6.
Conceptual development plans and sketch plans submitted pursuant to section 66-6.
D.
Nothing in this section 70-4 shall be construed to exempt any development from complying with the requirement for adequate fire flow set forth in chapter 34 of the county code, Fire Prevention and Protection, as the same may be amended, replaced or modified. Fulfillment of the requirements set forth in chapter 34 may be a condition of approval for all development projects.
II.
Water demand estimate and criteria
. At the time of project submittal, all development subject to these water quantity and quality standards must provide the county with a representative estimate of the development’s peak daily water demand during a period of sustained water usage, according to either the stated requirements set forth in this subsection II or based upon completion of a site-specific water demand study. Required fire flows, if any, are not part of the water demand estimates required under this subsection II.
Any proposed development that establishes to the director's satisfaction that the proposed project has no water demand is not required to comply with the remaining portions of this section 70-4.
A.
Peak daily water demand required. Estimated water demand based upon the proposed development’s peak daily water demand shall be provided.
B.
Demand associated with water treatment. If a given water source requires water quality treatment, the peak daily water demand shall be increased to account for the water consumed by the anticipated treatment process. The applicant shall provide a specification sheet for the treatment unit or a statement from the engineer designing the treatment system (e.g. chlorinated cistern) that estimates the water efficiency of the treatment process.
C.
Residential uses.
1.
General demand. Except as otherwise provided herein, water demand for all residential projects shall be estimated to be three hundred fifty (350) gpd per dwelling unit, which accounts for both in-house demand (e.g., drinking, cooking, bathing, and washing) and outdoor demand during peak season (e.g., landscaping and irrigation).
2.
Multifamily dwelling demand. Residential uses that are multifamily dwellings with an anticipated irrigated area (e.g., lawn or garden) of one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet or less per dwelling unit (including each dwelling unit’s individual private irrigated area and its pro rata share of any irrigable common areas or open space) shall be subject to the following calculations:
a.
The minimum daily quantity requirement for
landscaping
or irrigation demand is 0.105 gallons per square foot per day.
b.
The general
residential
demand estimate of three hundred fifty (350) gpd may be reduced by 0.105 gallons per square foot, for each square foot of irrigated area less than one thousand five hundred
(1,500), as illustrated below.
a.
Figure 70-4: Residential Demand Estimate
b.
20’ x 40’ = 800f2 irrigable lawn
c.
1,500 f2 - 800 f2 = 700 f2
d.
700 f2 x .105 = 74 gpd
e.
350 gpd -74 gpd = 276 gpd residential demand estimate
c.
In no instance shall the minimum indoor demand be less than one hundred ninety-five (195) gpd.
d.
As an alternative to the calculation set forth above in sub-subparagraphs II.C.2.a-b, an applicant proposing development of a multifamily dwelling may conduct a site-specific water demand study pursuant to paragraph II.E below.
D.
Nonresidential water demand.
1.
Calculation based on Table 70-4 A. Nonresidential water demand, including but not limited to those for all commercial and industrial uses, shall be calculated based on the proposed use, according to the rates set forth in Table 70-4 A. Table 70-4 A’s rates are cumulative. Uses implicating two (2) or more of the listed demands must include all demands to derive the total required demand.
2.
Alternative methods for calculation. For any proposed use not listed below, and for which a site-specific water demand study is not specifically required, during the pre-application process prior to project submittal, the applicant may choose to prepare a site-specific water demand study pursuant to paragraph II.E. below, or subject to paragraph II.E., the applicant may request that the director determine, in writing, the applicable rates by equating or approximating a proposed use’s demand based on commonality with one (1) or more uses listed below. If the director determines that the proposed use is not sufficiently comparable to a use listed in Table 70-4 A for the purpose of estimating the proposed use’s water demand, the director may require the applicant to complete a site-specific water demand study.

1.
Service by existing
public water provider
or
designated regional public water provider
.
a.
Adequate legal water supply for the
development
may be established as follows:
a.
At project submittal, written confirmation from an existing public water provider or designated regional public water provider stating that such provider has the physical and legal capacity to serve the development and is willing to provide a water supply sufficient for build-out of the proposed development, including the information required in paragraph IV.A below if applicable.

Sec. 70-5 Compatibility assessment
a.
Applicability.
All applications for minor and major land use permits shall be assessed in terms of the proposed development’s ability to achieve and maintain compatibility with the natural environment and the existing and desired uses where the development is located as described in this section.
b.
Conformance with adopted plans.
All applications shall be in general conformance with the county’s adopted plans including but not limited to the comprehensive plan and applicable district plan. In determining compatibility, the decision-making body shall weigh competing goals, policies, objectives, and strategies and may approve an application that provides public benefit even if the development is contrary to some of the goals, policies, objectives, or strategies of the adopted plans.
c.
Compatibility criteria.
All applications for minor and major land use permits shall demonstrate compatibility through compliance with the standards set forth in this code and fulfilling the criteria in this section. The standards in this code are those considered to be the minimum necessary to achieve compatibility and shall not be lessened except where a variance is obtained. Fulfillment of the criteria may be achieved through the implementation of mitigation measures for all potential adverse impacts. A compatible development is one which will achieve each of the following:
A.
Appropriate densities and uses for the parcel. In determining appropriate densities and uses for the parcel, the decision-making body shall take into account, among other things, the parcel’s physical characteristics including natural topography and the location of the property relative to available infrastructure and community services.
B.
Avoidance of unmitigated nuisance conditions. The development shall not create nuisance conditions that negatively impact adjacent properties or the public. The following nuisances shall be contained within and beyond the development parcel’s property lines.
1.
Noise. Noise shall not exceed the established levels as set forth in section 70-21.
2.
Odor. Subject to any applicable federal or state law, no development shall produce adverse or noxious odors as perceived at the development’s property line. At a minimum, the development shall comply with CDPHE, Air Quality Control Commission, Regulation No. 2 Odor Emissions, 5 CCR 1001-4.
3.
Vibration. All equipment and structures associated with the development shall, when applicable, be anchored or constructed so transmission of vibrations is not detectable on surrounding properties through the ground or air.
4.
Dust. Dust generated on-site shall not impact surrounding properties. Where non-paved roads are created or used by the development, the development shall provide adequate dust suppression.
5.
Glare. Reflective materials utilized for new development shall not produce brightness to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance as seen from the public right of way or from surrounding properties.
6.
Hours of operation. The decision-making body shall establish hours of operation that best mitigate offsite impacts and based upon the hours in Ch. 73.
C.
Pollution control practices and permits. Development shall not impermissibly cause pollution of groundwater or surface waters, air and soil. Where applicable, the applicant shall identify any substances, contaminants or human-made or human-induced alteration of the chemical, physical, biological, or radiological integrity of air, ground, or water and provide a copy of the regulatory permit and permit conditions demonstrating conformance to the standards adopted by the applicable regulating agency.
D.
Maintenance of existing character. Development, whether through density, type of use or otherwise, should strive to maintain the existing characteristics and conditions of an area but, where not feasible, mitigation measures are required. If the development will change the existing characteristics or conditions of an area, the applicant shall demonstrate the surrounding area’s characteristics are already changing to such a degree that it is in the public interest to encourage a new use in the area. Consideration of the characteristics of the surrounding area shall encompass one-quarter (¼) mile from the subject parcel’s property line.
Where conflicting land uses are proposed, the applicant shall identify mitigation for all potential adverse impacts sufficient to achieve each of the following:
1.
Orderly land use pattern. The proposed development generally shall not result in an illogical or otherwise unorderly land use pattern.
2.
Adequate buffering. The development’s lot size shall be large enough to allow for adequate buffering for the adjacent use, and to ensure adequate privacy for adjacent uses.
3.
Minimal increase in density. Density of new lots should be generally similar to the density of surrounding properties as measured from one-quarter (¼) mile of the subject parcel’s property line.
4.
Similarity of structures. Structures associated with new development shall be generally of the same scale, mass, height, and configuration of surrounding land uses.
5.
No increase in hazards. The proposed development shall not create or result in hazards, to an extent greater than other uses in the surrounding area to which it would be added.
6.
Application of development standards. Application of required development standards that result in infrastructure improvements that are not generally comparable with the characteristics of surrounding land uses.
E.
Adequate provision of services. The development shall not have a significant adverse effect on the ability of local governments and quasi-governmental agencies to provide the services necessary to accommodate the development or exceed the capacity of existing service delivery systems. The applicant shall submit an evaluation of the expected demands and effects of the development on service delivery systems, including but not limited to water: transportation, sanitation, electricity, fire protection, schools, police and flood protection.
F.
Natural environment and resources. The development shall not adversely impact the natural environment and/or resources within the surrounding area, which includes critical lands such as but not limited to: archeological or cultural sites, existing wildlife habitat and migration corridors, and wetlands and riparian areas. In considering gravel, sand, topsoil and mineral extraction which may inherently adversely impact the natural environment and resources, the decision-making body shall consider best management practices for the mitigation of environmental impacts under the circumstances and final reclamation of the subject property to a form beneficial to the natural environment.
d.
Mitigation measures.
If the development parcel has physical constraints or lacks compatibility for one or more criteria, the applicant shall propose measures designed to mitigate the adverse impacts created by the development, including, but not limited to mitigation measures, as identified in Table 70-5.

A.
General setback criteria.
1.
The front lot line shall be that from which primary access is obtained.
2.
On corner lots, each right-of-way frontage shall meet front setback regulations.
3.
Above-grade architectural features including but not limited to: decks, eaves, attached canopies (excluding carports), or other similar features may encroach up to five (5) feet into a required setback.
4.
Above-grade surface equipment for propane and other utility gasoline or oil shall be setback a minimum of ten (10) feet from any right-of-way.
5.
Should a greenbelt or open space exist between the property line and the public right-of-way, the greenbelt or open space may be applied to the setback.
6.
Fences and screening, buffering, privacy, and retaining walls are exempt from these setback requirements.
B.
Setbacks from streams, lakes, rivers, and wetlands. Structures and improvements shall have a minimum setback of fifty (50) horizontal feet as measured from the wetlands, and bank high-water line of streams and rivers. Roads, driveways, utilities, drainage features, and fences shall comply with the fifty (50) foot setback requirement to the maximum extent practicable as determined by the director.
C.
Measurements.
1.
Front/side/rear property line. Property line setbacks shall be measured as the shortest distance between the lot or property line and the closest exterior wall or projection of a building or structure along a line at right angles to the lot or property line.
2.
Highway and road setbacks. For state highways, county roads and all other streets and roads, roadway setbacks are measured as the shortest distance between the edge of right-of-way and the closest exterior wall or projection of a structure or improvement. Alternately, if the width of the right-of-way is unknown, the setback shall be measured from the road center line with an additional forty (40) feet added to the minimum roadway setback requirement.
D.
Development prohibited within right-of-way. Development and obstructions within a county right-of-way or easement is prohibited and shall be removed by the property owner immediately upon discovery, at the owner’s expense. Failure to remove development or an obstruction within the right-of-way or easement may be a violation of C.R.S. § 43-5-301, subject to criminal prosecution and civil action by the county.
E.
Land use permit setback criteria. The applicant may propose alternative setbacks which meet the criteria of this subsection, except for setbacks from public roads which are required to be twenty (20) feet or prescribed elsewhere in this code, such as Ch. 73 or Ch. 90. The review body and decision-making body shall review the adequacy of the proposed setbacks using all setback criteria in this section. If the review body or decision-making body finds that the proposed setbacks do not meet the criteria, it shall increase or decrease the setbacks. The permit application shall be denied or continued until setbacks that comply with this subsection are provided. Structures shall be set back far enough from the property line to allow for:
1.
Sunlight and air to enter the structure;
2.
Preventing the spread of fire;
3.
Maintaining existing vegetation whenever possible. Existing vegetation may require alternative setbacks;
4.
Protecting the privacy of neighbors. Development which causes noise, odor, dust, smoke, glare, vibration, unsightly equipment or other external effects which can reasonably disturb neighbors may require alternative setbacks;
5.
Compatibility with similar existing setbacks in the general area;
6.
Providing room for snow removal and for preventing the shedding of snow onto adjacent properties or facilities and roadways;
7.
Adequate visibility of traffic from driveways and intersections;
8.
Meeting building code requirements;
9.
Adequate ingress, egress and general traffic safety;
10.
Adequate building maintenance between properties.
II.
Structure height. The following height standards shall apply to all new development in the county, except for sign structures, telecommunication facilities and small scale solar that are governed by the chapters 70 and 98, and except where a different height is permitted as part of an approved planned unit development or development agreement.
A.
The maximum structure height shall not exceed thirty (30) feet within twenty-five (25) feet of the lot line adjacent to a lot containing a dwelling unit or vacant lot.
B.
Properties subject to regulations set forth in the Animas Valley Land Use Plan in chapter 65 shall have a general maximum building height of thirty (30) feet for all nonagricultural structures, and a maximum of thirty-five (35) feet for agricultural structures.
C.
Roof height measurement. Roof height measurements shall be taken from the mid-point of pre or post construction grade whichever is more restrictive, and the midpoint of the eave of a pitched roof or the highest point of a flat roof or parapet.
III.
Verifying setbacks or structure height. The applicant or owner may be required, at the applicant or owner’s expense, to verify compliance with the height or setback requirements of this section through a site improvement location certificate, if requested by the director.
IV.
Oil and gas reciprocal setbacks.
A.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide standards to separate dwelling units, including high occupancy building units, from existing industrial oil and gas uses to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as noise, glare, and odors; to minimize adverse impacts and to minimize risks posed by air pollutants, hazardous materials, site contamination or pollution or danger from fires or explosions.
B.
Definitions and measurements. The terms “flowlines”, “high occupancy building units”, “minimize adverse impacts”, “oil and gas location”, “pipeline”, “well”, “well site” and “working pad surface” used in this section 70-6 shall have the meaning set forth in chapter 90. When determining the methodology for measuring the distances described in this section, the methodology of the ECMC shall be used, it being the intent that the setback requirements set forth in this section be consistent with and determined in the same manner as setback requirements imposed on new oil and gas development.
C.
Minimum distances from oil and gas locations.
1.
Unless the flowline(s) or pipeline(s) have been properly abandoned in place under chapter 90, no dwelling unit or high occupancy building units shall be allowed within fifty (50) feet of an existing or county permitted flowline or pipeline.
2.
No dwelling units or high occupancy building units shall be allowed within four hundred (400) feet of an existing or county permitted working pad surface.
3.
No commercial buildings, industrial buildings, public or private playgrounds, parks, permanent recreational fields or similar places of public assembly or community spaces shall be allowed within three hundred (300) feet of an existing or county permitted working pad surface.
4.
No development of any kind shall be placed in a location that causes final reclamation of the nearby OGL to be impossible, including without limitation locations that restrict the access to the OGL in a manner that prevents access by the equipment anticipated to be necessary to perform final reclamation of the OGL.
D.
Buffer reduction.
1.
From plugged and abandoned or dry and abandoned wells. An applicant may request the decision-making body approve a reduced buffer distance from a plugged and abandoned well or a dry and abandoned well for which final reclamation has been completed in accordance with chapter 90 and the regulations of the ECMC, provided the approved reduced buffer is no less than one hundred fifty (150) feet from the permanently abandoned well and the decision-making body determines the proposed alternative minimizes adverse impacts and reduces the nuisances referenced in this section equally well or better than the requirement set forth in subsection 70-6.IV.
2.
Uses by right. A setback imposed by subparagraph 70-6.IV.C.2 or 3 above may be reduced to no less than two hundred (200) feet from an existing or county permitted well if the proposed development does not require a land use permit under section 66-3 and is on a legal lot of record that existed before August 1, 2023.

Sec. 70-8 Avoidance of natural hazards and protection of sensitive lands
I.
Purpose.
Natural hazards, including geologic hazards, pose a risk to county residents and their property. Development also occurs in the natural habitat of wildlife species. Development must therefore be sensitive to, and take account of, these natural conditions. This section establishes standards intended to:
A.
Partially fulfill the goals and objectives of the county’s 2018 Multijurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan, including but not limited to:
1.
Minimize loss of life and injury to people due to anticipated hazard events;
2.
Reduce damage to critical facilities and infrastructure;
3.
Reduce risks to property, the environment and economy of the county from the impacts of natural hazards.
B.
Protect the county’s significant natural resources, including areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as rivers and streams, wetlands, and critical wildlife habitat;
C.
Plan and design land uses to be harmonious with wildlife habitat and the species that depend on that habitat for the economic, recreational and environmental benefit of county residents and visitors.
II.
Applicability.
Unless otherwise excepted, these standards apply to all new development and land disturbing activity where such activity occurs on land that contains any of the natural resources, steep slope areas, habitat, or hazard areas addressed by this section. Each lot or parcel shall contain a buildable area that complies with this section’s standards.
A.
Exemptions – These standards do not apply to:
1.
Agricultural operations and structures: Agricultural activities such as soil preparation, irrigation including irrigation district and ditch activities, and irrigation pipelines, planting, plowing, harvesting, and grazing.
2.
Minor land disturbing activities: Activities that will disturb less than five thousand (5,000) square feet in area and less than eighteen (18) inches in depth and that are not required to obtain a building permit.
3.
Oil and gas drilling activities: See chapter 90 for applicable standards.
III.
Submittal requirements.
In addition to the general land use permit application submittal requirements set forth in section 66-11, applicant shall submit the following documents and materials: a site analysis map that provides information about existing physical site conditions and context, and that comprehensively analyzes existing physical conditions both on and off the proposed development site.
IV.
Existing maps and other data sources.
The information presented in the site analysis map should be produced primarily from existing governmental sources, maps, and data. However, in some instances accurate and reliable mapping may not be available at a site-specific level of detail. In situations where existing mapping and resources are unavailable or inaccurate, or where the applicant disputes the mapped boundaries of a resource or hazard area, the applicant shall retain a qualified professional acceptable to the county and with demonstrated expertise in the field to delineate the boundaries of any resource or hazard area addressed by this section’s standards.
V.
Protection of wetlands.
Boundary delineation of wetlands shall be established by reference to the current USACE Wetlands Delineation Manual, which is available for reference in the USACE office. All wetland boundary delineations are subject to the county’s approval.
A.
No person shall engage in any activity that shall disturb, remove, fill, drain, dredge, clear, destroy, or alter any area, including vegetation, within a wetland that falls in the jurisdiction of the federal government and its agencies, except as may be expressly allowed under applicable federal laws or regulations.
B.
Notwithstanding any contrary federal law or regulations, draining any wetland that falls in the jurisdiction of the federal government and its agencies is prohibited.
C.
The county shall not grant final approval to any development or activity, including subdivisions, in a wetland that falls within the federal government’s jurisdiction until the applicant shows that all necessary federal approvals and permits have been obtained.
D.
The county shall not prohibit execution of a permitted mitigation plan or maintenance of those projects, nor shall it take responsibility for the mitigation project, even within areas to be accepted by the county upon final acceptance of all improvements. A letter from the USACE, accepting the mitigation, is required to release the development from further obligations.
VI.
Avoidance of steep slope areas
. Improper uses and disturbances on steep slopes may cause erosion, lead to structural failure, and increase downstream flooding and other hazards. The provisions in this subsection are intended to reduce potential for hazards due to slope failure, reduce potential for increased erosion and sedimentation, as well as preserve the visual quality of steep slope areas, which are a valuable natural and economic resource in the county. Where steep slope areas exist, the following shall apply:
A.
The USGS quadrangle maps shall be used to delineate steep slope areas on the site analysis map. A field-prepared or aerial topographic survey of greater accuracy (two (2) feet or smaller contour interval), having a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet, certified by a licensed surveyor or professional engineer may also be used.
B.
Slope shall be computed on the existing slope of the land before any grading for the proposed development has commenced, as determined from the topographic survey.
VII.
Geologic hazard areas.
Geologic hazard areas have the potential to pose hazards to human life and safety and to property due to their geologic characteristics. Geologic hazard areas in the county include but are not limited to landslide areas, avalanche chutes, debris fans, rock falls, and areas with potentially unstable soils or slopes. This subsection is intended to ensure that new development avoids these geologic hazard areas to the maximum extent feasible. Where it is not possible for development to avoid these areas, standards are provided to reduce or minimize the potential impacts of the hazard on the occupants of the property and the occupants of adjacent properties, and to reduce or minimize the environmental impacts of development in these areas.
A.
Delineation of geologic hazard areas. The standards in this section apply to those areas delineated on the La Plata County Geologic Hazards Maps, prepared by the Colorado Geological Survey (CGS) that depicts the location of geologic hazard areas and parcels where field verification by a professional geologist determines the parcel contains geologic hazards although the Geologic Hazard Maps may not reveal such hazards. Conversely, if the Geological Survey maps indicate the parcel is in the location of a geologic hazard area and the applicant provides a field survey by a professional geologist which demonstrates no hazards or minimal hazards that do not require mitigation, the director may accept the field verification and waive compliance with this section’s mitigation requirements.
B.
Mitigation plan required. Applicants proposing development within a mapped or identified geologic hazard area shall prepare and submit a mitigation plan prepared by a professional geologist that addresses how such development will either avoid or substantially mitigate the identified hazard. The plan shall identify how to avoid the creation or increase in the severity of adverse impacts on adjacent properties, including county roadways, as a result of the development.
C.
Referral to CGS. The county shall refer all applications for new development within an identified geologic hazard area, and mitigation plan, to the Colorado Geological Survey (CGS) for review and comment.
1.
CGS will review the application and provide comments to staff. The review shall be used to determine if the mitigation plan for the proposed development reduces or minimizes the potential impacts of the hazards on the occupants of the property and the occupants of adjacent properties, and to reduce or minimize the environmental impacts of development in the area.
2.
If CGS determines the applicant has not adequately addressed geologic hazards on the property, or that the application is otherwise incomplete or inadequate, staff shall require the applicant to revise the application to properly address the CGS’s comments and concerns or a qualified consultant retained by the county pursuant to section 66-11.
D.
Geologic hazard area development standards. No development shall expose persons (including emergency service personnel or neighboring properties) to significant and unmitigated dangers or risk or be located or designed in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the resources of the county. Development may be permitted in a geologic hazard area if the development complies with the following minimum requirements and standards:
1.
When the collection and submittal of data, and design of structural or mechanical elements are required by this subsection VII, the data and design shall be certified by a professional engineer, or by a professional geologist. Such designs shall be based on site-specific geotechnical analyses and recommendations, including, where appropriate, a geotechnical analysis of adjacent properties that may be impacted by the development.
2.
The development shall not cause or intensify adverse natural conditions in a geologic hazard area, whether on-site or off-site. Site planning and engineering methods shall substantially mitigate any potential hazards to public health, safety, and welfare, including but not limited to the following, where applicable:
a.
Except as described in subsection 70-8.XI. pertaining to steep slopes, driveways and subdivision roads shall avoid geologic hazard areas to the maximum extent feasible;
b.
Above ground utility facilities located in the hazard area shall be protected by barriers or diversion techniques. The determination to locate utility facilities above ground shall be based on the recommendations and requirements of the utility service provider and approved by the county. The activities associated with the development that increase the existing grade of a potentially unstable slope or slide area, or that remove vegetation or other natural support materials that contribute to site stability are prohibited.
c.
When the proposed location of development alone will not provide adequate protection for people and structures from geologic hazards, then the applicant shall also comply with construction practices recommended by a professional engineer, or by a professional geologist, to artificially stabilize, support, buttress, or retain the potential hazard area, and to control surface and subsurface drainage that affects the area. The proposed locations, dimensions, and specification of such mitigation measures and other protective measures shall be included in the application.
d.
When a geological hazard cannot be avoided, the development shall be restricted to those areas on the property that are subject to the least degree of potential hazard and has been located as far away as possible from landslide paths.
3.
As a condition of approval of the proposed development, all plats, the applicable land use permit, and the applicable document that approves the application shall contain appropriate language approved by the county to identify and disclose any geologic hazard.
4.
If the design or mitigation measures will result in an alteration of the natural drainage of surface water, including mud or debris, the applicant shall obtain a drainage easement from impacted downstream property owners. A natural watercourse may be used as a conduit or outlet for the drainage so long as the augmented flow will not tax the stream beyond its capacity and cause flooding of adjacent properties. The applicant may be required to mitigate impacts off-site.
E.
Development in avalanche hazard areas. Development may be permitted in an avalanche hazard area if the development complies with the following minimum requirements and standards, as certified by a professional engineer:
1.
Building construction shall be certified to withstand avalanche impact and static loads and otherwise protected by external avalanche defense structures that have been similarly certified;
2.
Driveways and subdivision roads shall avoid areas where avalanches have return periods of fewer than ten (10) years;
3.
Clear cutting or other large-scale removal of vegetation is prohibited in avalanche path starting zones, or in other locations that can increase the potential avalanche hazard on the parcel.
F.
Development in landslide hazard areas. Development may be permitted to occur in landslide hazard areas only if the development complies with the following minimum requirements and standards, as certified by a professional engineer:
1.
Development shall comply with recommended construction practices to artificially stabilize, support, buttress, or retain the potential slide area and to control surface and subsurface drainage that affects the slide area.
2.
The following development activities shall be prohibited in landslide hazard areas:
a.
Activities that add water or weight to the top of the slope, or along the length of the slope, or otherwise decrease the stability of the hazard area. Measures and structural improvements to permanently control surface and subsurface drainage from the development shall be required;
b.
Activities that remove vegetation or other natural support material that contributes to its stability;
c.
Activities that increase the steepness of a potentially unstable slope;
d.
Activities that remove the toe of the landslide, unless adequate mechanical support is provided.
G.
Development in rockfall hazard areas. Development may be permitted to occur in rockfall hazard areas only if the applicant demonstrates that the development cannot avoid such areas and the development complies with the following minimum requirements and standards, as certified by a professional engineer:
1.
Development shall comply with recommended construction practices to minimize the degree of hazard. Construction practices may include without limitation:
a.
Stabilizing rocks by bolting, gunite application (cementing), removal of unstable rocks (scaling), cribbing, or installation of retaining walls;
b.
Slowing or diverting moving rocks with rock fences, screening, channeling, damming, or constructing concrete barriers or covered galleries;
c.
Installation of structural barriers around vulnerable structures to prevent rock impact.
2.
The following development activities shall be prohibited in rockfall hazard areas:
a.
Activities that add water or weight to, or otherwise decrease the stability of, cliffs or overhanging strata;
b.
Activities that will reduce stability, including activities that remove vegetation or other natural support material, or that require excavation, or cause erosion that will remove underlying support to a rockfall hazard area.
H.
Development in alluvial fan hazard areas. Development shall only be permitted to occur in an alluvial fan if the applicant demonstrates the development cannot avoid such areas, and the development complies with the following minimum requirements and standards, as certified by a professional engineer:
1.
Development shall be protected using structures or other measures on the uphill side that channel, dam, or divert the potential mud or debris flow.
2.
Disturbance shall be prohibited in the drainage basin above an alluvial fan, unless an evaluation of the effect on runoff and stability of the fan and on the groundwater recharge area shows that disturbance is not substantial or can be successfully mitigated.
I.
Slope development.
1.
Slopes twenty (20) percent or greater.

Sec. 70-12 Noxious weed control plan
Noxious weeds represent a threat to the continued economic and environmental value of lands in the county. The purpose of this section is to establish standards designed to ensure that development does not contribute to the establishment of invasive, non-native weeds on lands within the county and to control the production and spread of noxious weeds on developing properties within the county, in conformance with C.R.S. § 35-5.5-101
et seq
: “The Colorado Noxious Weed Act.”
I.
Applicability.
While all properties are subject to Colorado laws pertaining to noxious weeds, the standards in this section apply to all projects that involve land disturbance, including subdivisions, major land use permits; and any development activity that requires a grading permit. All agricultural activities including but not limited to cleaning and maintaining ditches and canals, installations and repair of irrigation pipelines and construction of ponds shall be exempt.
II.
Weed control standards.
Development subject to this section shall submit a Site Revegetation and Weed Control Plan (WCP). The WCP shall describe the combination of methods that will be employed on the property to prevent the establishment of noxious weeds and to control the spread of noxious weeds. For properties involving extensive land disturbance (more than twenty (20) acres of land disturbed), the county may also require that the WCP provide for the long-term monitoring of the spread of weeds on the property, with periodic reporting by the applicant to the county on the effectiveness of the noxious weed prevention and control measures being employed.
A.
Targeted weed species. The targeted species of noxious weeds that shall be addressed in the WCP are those species listed on the La Plata County Noxious Weed List, which is available from the county.
B.
Prevention techniques. The WCP shall specify the combination of techniques the applicant will employ to prevent the further spread of noxious weeds that are already present on the property, and to prevent the establishment of new noxious species that do not currently occur on the site. Prevention can be accomplished by minimizing the amount of bare soil that is created as a result of land development; re-vegetating disturbed areas as soon after disturbance as possible; ensuring that weeds are not introduced through topsoil, gravel, equipment and irrigation water; and periodic inspection of the property after development, followed by eradication of small new infestations of weeds.
C.
Minimum revegetation standards. At a minimum, the WCP shall specify how revegetation and reclamation of disturbed areas will be accomplished. In all cases revegetation shall be completed within no more than one (1) calendar year after the date of substantial completion of soil disturbance, using appropriate native plant species as approved by the county. For phased projects, revegetation shall be completed within no more than one (1) calendar year after the date of substantial completion of soil disturbance related to each phase.
D.
Control techniques. Where targeted noxious weeds are present on a development site, the WCP shall also specify the combination of techniques the applicant will employ to control the spread of (and where possible, to eradicate) those weeds. These techniques include biological and chemical controls and mechanical or management practices. The most effective combination of such techniques available, as recommended annually by the Colorado State Weed Science Program, shall be employed on the property. The WCP shall specify the frequency with which such techniques will be applied, and the level of performance expected from the control program (that is, by how much the weed cover is planned to be reduced).
1.
Biological and chemical controls that may be employed to disrupt the growth of noxious weeds include the use of insects or grazing animals (such as goats) and the treatment of weeds with herbicides.
2.
Mechanical practices that may be employed to disrupt the growth of noxious weeds include tilling, mowing, hand-pulling, shoveling and chopping. Mechanical practices shall be employed prior to seed production and dispersal.
3.
Management practices that may be employed are those that support the growth of desired native plants over invasive species. Such practices include proper use of moisture, fertilization, re-seeding and crop rotation.
4.
Any new subdivision covenants shall include strategies to insure consistent application, enforcement and evaluation of the WCP.

Sec. 70-13 Right to farm and ranch policy
I.
Purpose
. Agriculture as a way of life benefits all residents within La Plata County. It is an important part of the economy and adds intrinsic value to life in the county. Agriculture brings with it noise, odors, dust, mud, smoke and other perceived inconveniences, such as ditch and field burning, machinery and livestock on public roads, odors from manure and feeds, odors from chemical applications, lights and noises at all hours of the day and night, and on-farm processing and marketing of crops and livestock. Those with urban sensitivities may perceive such activities, sights, sounds and smells as inconveniences. However, state law and county policy protect most agricultural practices from unnecessary, intrusive litigation.
II.
Authority.
State law and county policy provides that no inconvenience shall be considered a nuisance so long as it occurs as part of non-negligent and legal agricultural practices as stated in C.R.S. § 35-3.5-101
et seq
.
III.
Performance standards
. The county may impose conditions upon the approval of any development to ensure that it does not adversely affect adjacent or near-by agricultural operations, and to ensure that such development does not limit the viability of the agricultural operations. Conditions may address and mitigate, among other things, potential nuisance or liability issues, predation of stock by domestic dogs, traffic conflicts, interference with irrigation, proliferation of undesirable plants and rodents, erosion, and wildlife intrusion.
IV.
Plat notes.
In appropriate projects, the decision-making body may require a plat note providing notice that Colorado is a right to farm state.
V.
Fence law
. Colorado is a fence out law state. Owners of real property shall fence livestock out prior to recovery of damages for trespassing livestock, pursuant to C.R.S. § 35-46-101
et seq
. In appropriate projects, the decision-making body may require a plat notice that Colorado is a fence law state.

Sec. 70-14 Irrigation facilities
I.
Purpose.
Irrigation is necessary for agricultural operations in the county. Development has the potential to disrupt the delivery of irrigation water. Ditch companies and associations exist to acquire water rights, develop storage and deliver surface water to their members for irrigation and other purposes. Ditch companies generally own and maintain ditches from their head-gates to an established point where individual property owners or lateral associations manage smaller ditch systems. Only those who own water rights or have leased a right to the water may use the water flows through a ditch.
A.
Those who hold water rights in ditches have certain responsibilities associated with these rights. Irrigators have a legal duty to maintain canals or ditches used for irrigation purposes, ditch embankments and head-gates. Therefore, a ditch owner has the right to enter the property of another to perform “reasonably necessary” monitoring, inspection, maintenance and operations on the ditch and associated structures, even if it means disturbing land within the easement area.
B.
Similarly, those who own property through which these ditches run have the responsibility of keeping the ditch easement free of obstacles (such as fences, landscaping, or bridges) and to observe a right of way of access for the ditch owner or irrigator to enter with equipment to maintain or repair the ditch or adjust flows. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this code, these ditch easements are as wide as reasonably necessary for ditch maintenance and operations and this code is not intended to annul or abridge the ditch company’s historic rights. Owners of property subject to ditch easements should not cut or alter a ditch unless the property owner has the permission of the ditch owner or a court order. Site development shall account for easements and should also recognize the reality of events such as cleanouts, normal seepage and spills of storm waters in unpredictable locations and times.
II.
Applicability.
The provisions of this section apply to all development located on parcels that include irrigation facilities.
III.
Easements
. Ditch easements may be written or unwritten and may be expressly created or may arise by implication, prescription, condemnation, or parole license/estoppel. There are many factors that may impact the size of a ditch easement, including but not limited to the slope on which the ditch is located, the volume of water carried in the ditch, types of soils, and proximity of structures to the ditch. Easements for existing irrigation facilities, including adequate easements for maintenance and access, shall be dedicated and accurately located by appropriate survey data on all final plats. Sketch plans and preliminary plats shall show the top of ditch banks relative to the limits of the easement. Applications for development will be referred to the appropriate ditch companies for review and comment as provided in section 66-11.
IV.
Review criteria
.
A.
Written approval of the ditch owner or its representatives and, where applicable, the Colorado Division of Water Resources, shall be obtained for any proposed modifications of any irrigation facilities, including but not limited to realignments, changes to configurations or crossings.
B.
Road crossings over a ditch shall be bridged or culverted in a manner consistent with the county’s crossing requirements and consistent with the hydraulic requirements of the ditch company. The ditch company shall be consulted regarding all proposed ditch crossings and written consent of the ditch company and payment of applicable crossing fees may be required.
C.
The schedule for any proposed modifications approved under this section or other activities that may disrupt the flow of water must be referred to the ditch owner for review and comment. The decision-making body may require, by condition of approval, that such modifications be made, or such activities be conducted when the disruption of water flow will be minimized.
D.
The location of the center line of the ditch shall be denoted and will extend the length of the ditch through the development parcel. The minimum width of the easement will be the area between the ditch banks plus the following:
1.
For ditches having an average bottom width of less than eight (8) feet, the easement will be twenty-five feet (25) measured from the top of the ditch on one side of the ditch.
2.
For ditches having an average bottom width of eight feet (8), the easement will be thirty feet (30) measured from the top of the ditch on both sides of the ditch.
3.
The ditch owner shall be entitled to additional easement width where the ditch owner demonstrates:
a.
Terrain or other circumstances (such as existing maintenance roads on both sides of a ditch) necessitate a wider easement or additional easements to operate, repair and maintain the ditch;
b.
An entitlement to a wider easement by law or based on historical use or an agreement between the property owner and the ditch owner.
E.
If the decision-making body determines the existence of a ditch through a proposed development may result in improper use of that ditch for recreational purposes by residents of the development, or pose a safety risk to residents (such as childhood drownings) then the applicant may be required to take protective measures such as fencing or piping.
F.
When the decision-making body determines that unreasonable, unnecessary or extraordinary requirements are proposed by a ditch owner, the decision-making body may approve only those requirements deemed appropriate to protect irrigation facilities.

Sec. 70-17 Landscaping and buffering
I.
Purpose.
Landscaping and buffers are used to reduce the external impacts a land use might have on adjacent properties, especially when neighboring land uses are of a different type or intensity than the subject use. Where used, landscaping and buffers provide visual barriers between different land uses, enhance the streetscape and public views, provide privacy, and protect uses from wind, dust, noise, traffic, glare, visual impact and harmful or noxious effects.
II.
Applicability.
The following types of development shall install and maintain landscaping and buffers in accordance with the standards in this section:
A.
Any development that requires a minor land use permit or major land use permit;
B.
Any development that includes a parking lot or a parking area adjacent to a public or private road;
C.
Any development that requires an administrative land use permit within an economic development area; and
D.
Any other development required to use landscaping or other buffers as a condition of approval to satisfy compatibility or otherwise mitigate adverse effects.
III.
Buffer materials and specifications
. Where required, buffers shall consist of landscaping, rocks, boulders, mounds, fences or walls, berms, or a combination of these techniques. In the case of commercial, multi-family or industrial development, fences are acceptable where space or the land use does not lend itself to a more natural buffer.
A.
Xeriscaping or low water usage is recommended for all development subject to this section. Developments that have access to raw water rights are encouraged to utilize raw water systems to accommodate landscape irrigation needs.
B.
If irrigation water is to be made available in a development, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to install an acceptable delivery system. The irrigation system shall be constructed and subject to the terms and conditions of other public improvements in the development.
C.
Landscaped berms or integrated rock walls shall be at least two (2) feet high and appear natural. Berms shall have a gentle transition to surrounding grade and shall not exceed a 3:1 side slope.
D.
Landscaped berms shall install plant species that are currently known to survive in the county. Existing native vegetation and trees may be used to comply with the buffer plant material specifications, provided the existing vegetation and trees are located where they can achieve the same intent and purpose of the buffer. Plant materials as listed on the most current noxious plant material list adopted by the board shall not be allowed. A list of recommended and prohibited plant materials may be obtained from the County Weed Control Technician.
1.
Tree plantings shall consist of at least fifty (50) percent coniferous species in order to provide year-round buffering.
2.
Coniferous trees shall be at minimum six (6) feet in height. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum two (2) inch caliper. All trees shall include protective fencing.
3.
At minimum, one-gallon (#5) container shrubs shall be installed along landscaped berms.
E.
For every fifty (50) linear feet of required buffering along each property line, the following plants shall be used at a minimum:
1.

F.
A waiver to the above paragraphs III.D or C may be requested from the director to provide an alternative type of buffering where circumstances warrant site specific considerations.
G.
All proposed landscaping or buffers must allow for compliance with snow removal and traffic-related sight-distance requirements, as reviewed and confirmed by the planning engineer.
IV.
Guarantees and maintenance.
Maintenance of landscaping, buffering and irrigation shall be the responsibility of the developer or landowner, and shall be performed regularly so that the intent and integrity of the approved landscaping is preserved, and noxious weeds are kept under control. Trees shall be staked and protected from damage upon planting and provision made by the developer or landowner for regular watering and maintenance until they are established. The developer or landowner shall replace dead and dying plants or trees no later than the following planting season and ensure continuous compliance with an approved weed control plan.
A.
Landscaping areas that cannot naturally be provided with adequate moisture for the types of plants to be installed shall be equipped with an irrigation system or other approved method.
B.
Applicants will warrant all buffers and other landscaping for one (1) year from the time of installation to guarantee the establishment of plant materials in the buffer. In addition, applicants shall provide a performance guarantee in an amount sufficient to cover the replacement cost of the plant materials and in a form acceptable to the county. The director may waive the performance guarantee if a permanent irrigation system is in place or installed. The guarantee shall, upon written request to the director, be released after inspection satisfactory to the director, but no sooner than one (1) year from the date of installation. Landscaping that does not survive within the initial year shall be replaced within three (3) months after it perishes, unless the date is not during a planting season, in which case it shall be replaced during the first month of the planting season. The replacement vegetation shall be similar in size, type and amount of the vegetation that perished. If landscaping perishes within the first year, the applicant may be required to warranty the replacement landscaping for one (1) year from the time of replacement installation to again guarantee the establishment of plant materials. The replacement process and associated warranty may continue for a successive period as necessary to ensure survival of the plant material.

Sec. 70-18 Off-street parking and loading standards
I.
Purpose
. This section is intended to lessen congestion on roads and streets, and to ensure an adequate supply of parking spaces are provided for certain land uses.
II.
Applicability.
The off-street parking and loading standards of this section shall apply to the development of all new buildings and uses except for agricultural uses not requiring a land use permit and the construction of a single-family residence. The standards in this section shall also apply to the following expansion of use and change in use. Unless the expansion pertains to a nonconformity exempt from the requirement for a land use permit as described in section 79-3, the off-street parking and loading standards of this section shall apply to the expansion or enlargement of an existing building or use. Additional off-street parking or loading spaces shall be required only to serve the expanded or enlarged area, and not to make up any deficiency that may exist for the current building or use. Unless the change in use pertains to a nonconformity exempt from the requirement for a land use permit as described in section 79-3, any change in the use or manner of operation of a building or a parcel of land that increases the applicable off-street parking requirements shall require the applicant to provide the increased number of parking spaces prior to beginning to operate in the changed manner.
III.
Minimum required off-street parking.
The following table establishes the minimum number of off-street parking spaces to be provided for residential and nonresidential uses. For any proposed use not listed below, the director may determine, in writing, the applicable minimum number of spaces or other forms of parking required based upon commonality with one or more uses listed below. If there is no similar use, the applicant may be required to submit a study to establish the off-street parking standard for the use. The parking study shall set forth the standards of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) for comparable uses and may also describe the standards found in other recognized professional publications or those applied by communities similar to the county.

IV.
Calculating off-street parking requirements.
The following rules apply when calculating the off-street parking requirement applicable to a building or use:
A.
When the calculation of the number of required spaces results in a fractional number, any fraction of less than one-half (½) (≤0.49) shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number, while any fraction of one-half (½) (≥0.50) or more shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number.
B.
Unless otherwise specified, all square footage-based parking standards shall be calculated based on net leasable floor area, which includes only those areas within a building that are designed to be occupied for industrial, commercial or office purposes, and excludes common or public areas such as bathrooms, stairways, circulation corridors, and mechanical areas.
C.
Calculations of employee-based parking standards shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift at the business.
D.
Parking areas serving more than a single principal use shall provide parking in an amount equal to the total requirement of all the principal uses being served, unless the applicant obtains approval of a shared parking arrangement for use of the parking area. The director may approve a shared parking arrangement and may reduce the number of off-street parking spaces by up to twenty (20) percent of the total required for all uses if the applicant demonstrates that the uses have different operating hours or business periods whose demand for parking will not overlap with one another.
V.
Minimum dimensions for parking spaces and parking areas.
The following shall apply to all parking areas:
A.
The standard parking space shall be nine (9) feet in width and eighteen (18) feet in length.
B.
In parking lots containing twenty-five (25) or more spaces, up to twenty (20) percent of the spaces may be compact car spaces, with minimum dimensions of eight (8) feet in width and sixteen (16) feet in length.  Compact car spaces shall be designated for use with a sign.
C.
Parking spaces shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven (7) feet.

VI.
Design standards for parking and loading areas.
All internal driving surfaces and parking areas accommodating ten (10) or more vehicles shall be surfaced with all-weather material, such as concrete, asphalt, or other similar surface approved by the director. However, the director may grant a written request to allow alternative surface material for parking areas, provided a professional engineer can demonstrate the surface adequately serves the intended use of the parking area without adversely impacting the subject site or adjacent properties. Gravel surfaces, including surfaces treated with dust retardants, may only be permitted when air and water quality mitigation measures are sufficiently demonstrated.
A.
Paved surfaces shall be striped to demarcate the parking spaces, and directional arrows shall be provided to designate when there is one-way traffic.
B.
The minimum amount of parcel area devoted to off-street parking, where the parking area will not be paved with asphalt, concrete, or similar hard-surface materials, may be increased up to ten (10) percent to accommodate additional parking and maneuvering space needed in the absence of striped and demarcated parking spaces and drive aisles.
C.
Gravel surfaces shall be regularly treated with appropriate dust suppression measures as determined by a professional engineer.
D.
A turn-around area shall be provided for parking areas with twenty-five (25) or more parking spaces.
E.
All parking areas shall be located and designed in conjunction with a driveway, such that vehicles exiting from a parking space shall not be required to back onto a public right of way. Provided, however that vehicles exiting from a parking space for a residential property may back onto a residential street.
F.
Adequate space shall be provided for storage of snow removed from vehicular ways and parking and loading spaces. Storage of snow in required parking spaces is prohibited. Adequate drainage shall be provided for the snow storage area to accommodate snow melt and to ensure it does not drain onto adjacent property.
VII.
Parking spaces for persons with disabilities
. In no event shall there be fewer parking spaces designated for use only by persons with disabilities than what is required by section 1106.1 of the building code or otherwise required by applicable law. Such spaces shall also meet the following standards:
A.
Parking spaces for persons with disabilities shall be in close proximity to building entrances and shall be designed to permit occupants of vehicles to reach the building on an unobstructed path.
B.
All parking spaces for persons with disabilities shall be at least thirteen (13) feet in width, measured perpendicular to the angle of parking. The minimum width shall be reduced to nine feet (9) for any space located parallel to a pedestrian walk that is a minimum of four (4) feet in width. Accessible parking dimensions and design shall be provided in accordance with Americans with Disabilities Act, 43 U.S.C. 12101
et seq
., and the Fair Housing Act, 43 U.S.C. 12101
et seq
.
C.
Required spaces for persons with disabilities shall be identified with appropriate signs and pavement markings. Signs shall be posted directly in front of the parking space, at a height of no less than forty-two (42) nor more than seventy-two (72) inches.

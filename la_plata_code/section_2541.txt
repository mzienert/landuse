Section 69-10 Application submittal requirements
T
he
director
may waive one or more of the submittal requirements when the submittal information would be
impracticable
to create or not relevant to a determination whether the proposed
project
complies with the applicable standards for approval or if the county attorney determines that submittal requirements would contain proprietary or confidential information including, without limitation, information that is proprietary or confidential pursuant to state or federal law or regulations. If an
applicant
believes the submittal requirements may contain proprietary or confidential information, the applicant shall, rather than submitting such materials, first submit a statement of confidentiality to the county attorney setting forth, in general terms, the nature of the materials and, with specificity, the rationale and legal basis of the need for confidentiality including, if applicable, recitation of supporting legal authority. If the county attorney determines the submittal requirements are not proprietary or confidential, applicant shall submit the requirements within five (5) business days of such determination. Additional materials may be required under this chapter for particular types of projects. Unless waived the following submittal components are required:

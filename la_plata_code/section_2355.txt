Sec. 10-43. Destruction of Vicious Animals and Animals with Rabies
Nothing in this Part 4 shall be construed to prevent
animal control officers
from taking whatever action is reasonably necessary to protect themselves and the public from injury by any
animal.
Animal control officers are authorized to take appropriate measures, including destruction of the animal involved, to prevent death or
bodily injury
to the officer, other persons,
domestic animals
or
wildlife
by vicious animals, dangerous animals or animals with rabies.  Destruction of a vicious animal or animal with rabies, without notice to its
owner
, is authorized under this section only when no other means, including impoundment, can be employed to prevent death or injury.

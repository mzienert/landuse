I.
Purpose
. Stewardship of public funds is a fundamental responsibility of county government. The public must have confidence that public funds are spent prudently and transparently on its behalf, with proper planning and evaluation, in a manner that is open and fair to all.
Under the direction of the Board of County Commissioners (“BOCC”), the La Plata County Procurement Code (this “code”) sets forth the policies and procedures that adhere to applicable laws and a commitment to promote competition, maximize purchasing power, and ensure fair opportunity and equitable treatment of all who seek to do business with the county.
The purpose of this
code
is to guide county personnel in fulfilling their obligations to the public, grantors,
vendors
, and
contractors
in the expenditure of public funds. The code is a comprehensive reference manual for both county personnel and outside parties who have an interest in the county’s
procurement
and contracting processes. It is intended as a guide to good procurement practices and is to be used as a supplement to state law, sound business judgment in procurement and contracting.
The policies set forth in this code are intended to:
1.    Provide a procurement program encompassing nationally and regionally approved principles and practices.
2.    Be reviewed, thoughtfully and regularly, to ensure the utility of the code and to make periodic modifications          and improvements that will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the procurement function.
3.   Promote and encourage ethical management and efficiency in the county procurement procedures.
4.   Support consistent procurement procedures within all county departments.
5.   Bolster public confidence in public procurement procedures.
6.    Ensure the fair and equitable treatment of all persons dealing with the county procurement system.
7.    Provide increased economy in county procurement activities.
8.    Maximize the procurement value of county funds.
9.    Safeguard the high quality and integrity of the procurement system.
10.  Ensure that the expenditure of public funds complies with the terms and conditions of the funding source.
This code is presented in a manner that is intended to address each of these factors in a straightforward and       practical way.
Article 1 explains why, when and how to use this code.
Article 2 explains the roles and responsibilities of those involved in public procurement.
Article 3 explains how to select vendors and conduct county purchases.
Article 4 explains the key to every successful purchase: specifications and scopes of work.
Article 5 explains the competitive solicitation processes and the requirements of each.
Article 6 explains the contract options that apply to every purchase, regardless of amount.
Article 7 explains the determination, protest, claims and dispute resolution processes.
Article 8 explains the legal and ethical obligations of every public employee.
II. Authority.
This code is adopted pursuant to the power and authorities conferred by the laws of the State of Colorado, including but not limited to the following sections of the Colorado Revised Statutes: Article 11 of Title 30 (County Powers and Functions); Article 20 of Title 30 (Public Improvements); and Article 25 of Title 30 (Administration of County Finance).

In addition, while
elected officials
may adopt their own
procurement
procedures, to ensure compliance with federal procurement rules and regulations that are applicable to various federal grants and/or
contracts

15. Any other purchase the BOCC formally determines to be exempt due to reasons not anticipated by this code.
Nothing in this code shall prevent the county from complying with the terms and conditions of any grant, gift, bequest, contract, or cooperative agreement that is otherwise consistent with the law. If any provision of this code causes denial of state or federal monies that would otherwise be available to the county or is inconsistent with requirements of state or federal law, that provision shall be suspended to the extent necessary to prevent denial of the monies or to eliminate the inconsistency with state or federal law. Specifically, when procurement involves the expenditure of federal assistance or contract funds, procurement shall be conducted in accordance with any mandatory, applicable federal law and regulations.

Sec. 20-4 Introduction to public procurement
Procurement
in the public sector is the process through which a government acquires
goods
and
services
. The terms “procurement” and “purchasing” are often used interchangeably. However, strictly speaking, “purchasing” is only one of three stages of the public procurement cycle.
The three (3) stages of public procurement are:
I.
Planning and scheduling.
This stage includes defining the need, developing the means and methods to meet the need, including the method of source selection, assessing risks, and ensuring proper allocation of resources.
II.
Purchasing and source selection.
This stage represents the process through which qualified providers of goods and services are identified,
solicited
, evaluated, and ultimately selected. The method of source selection, dictated by the amount of the expenditure, is determined in the planning and scheduling stage.
III.
Contract formation and administration.
This stage includes confirmation of expected performance measures, finalization of terms and conditions, and signature of authorized parties. This stage also includes post-
award
compliance with and enforcement of the terms of the resulting
contract
, including payment of invoices and adherence to insurance, amendment and renewal requirements through contract completion.
The appropriate procurement process to be followed in any given circumstance is dependent upon a variety of factors. A conceptual framework for determining the appropriate process is summarized as follows:
1
. Nature of purchase.
The nature of the purchase dictates: (a) whether public competition is required, and (b) whether additional approvals are required.
2.
Amount spent.
The amount to be spent dictates: (a) who has the authority to make the purchase, (b) what kind of competitive solicitation, if any, is required, and (c) who has the authority to sign the contract.
3.
Memorialization
. Every purchase and sale, regardless of type or amount, must be memorialized in a written document that identifies the rights and obligations of both the
buyer
and the seller.

Effective on: 1/1/2021
Sec. 20.5 Definitions and acronyms
I.
Definitions
. The following words, terms and phrases shall have the meanings set forth in this section whenever they appear in this code unless otherwise specifically stated. Not all the words and phrases below, however, appear in the current version of the code.

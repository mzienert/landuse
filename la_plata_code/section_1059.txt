I.
Purpose
. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure uniform, safe and adequate access to public roads and to ensure the development and use of real property does not create demand for public improvements and services that cannot be met with existing public resources. Safe and adequate access exists when traffic volumes do not exceed the capacity of the road; when operating conditions on the road and at intersections do not fall below the specified level of service; and when pavement sections and structures can accommodate projected traffic.
II.
Applicability.
In addition to establishing requirements for the planning, design, construction and improvement of transportation facilities by land use permit applicants, the requirements contained in this chapter apply to all proposed uses and development within unincorporated areas of the county and to new transportation facilities planned, designed and constructed by the county; except:
A.
Development where no land use permit is required pursuant to section 66-3; provided, however, that all driveways shall comply with standards as noted in section 74-8 and subdivisions in which all lots are greater than thirty-five (35) acres shall comply with standards as noted in section 74-6;
B.
Additional dwelling units pursuant to section 73-3 that require a director determination; provided, however, that additional dwelling units may be subject to the applicability of driveway standards in 74-8;
C.
Lot consolidations
,
boundary adjustments
and
plat
amendments unless the changes to the
plat
create an
adverse impact
to new or existing roads;
D.
Temporary uses approved pursuant to section 66-6;
E.
Accessory uses approved pursuant to sections 66-5 and 66-6;
F.
Development in the joint planning area pursuant to section 72-2;
G.
Special events which are addressed in chapter 42 or 73-20 of the La Plata County Code;
H.
Asphalt overlays, resurfacing of existing roads and related maintenance activities;
I.
Reconstruction of existing county roads and bridges by the county;
J.
AgPlus uses, however, all driveways shall comply with standards as noted in section 74-8; and
K.
Telecommunication facilities.
III.
Road design publications
. In addressing the requirements of this chapter, horizontal and vertical alignment and other design data shall substantially conform to the latest addition of AASHTO’s A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets and, for minor local roads and low ADT roads, AASHTO’s Guidelines for Geometric Design. Designers are also expected to reference CDOT’s design manuals, this chapter and other documents, such as the comprehensive plan, the La Plata County Fire Code, International Fire Code and guidance documents published by the applicable local fire district.
IV.
Construction quality and materials
. All materials and construction required by this chapter shall comply with CDOT’s Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction.
V.
Traffic control plans and devices
. All traffic control devices, road striping, signs, markers, delineators and signalization shall be in accordance with the latest version of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highways Administration Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices or as shown in the latest version of CDOT’s M&S Standard Plans. A traffic control plan is required for all work on or within a county right-of-way. The plan shall conform to the standards set forth in the MUTCD. Traffic control plans shall be submitted to the public works director for approval no less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the performance of any work.
VI.
Professional qualifications and judgment.
All road, right-of-way and drainage designs required by this chapter shall be prepared under the supervision of a professional engineer. Unless waived by the planning engineer or public works director, traffic analyses and construction plans shall be prepared, signed and sealed by a professional engineer. Because these standards cannot provide for all situations, the standards set forth in this chapter assist, but do not substitute for, competent work by design professionals. Design professionals shall consider all available information and use professional judgment to propose a final design. The public works director or planning engineer will evaluate proposed designs that depart from the requirements outlined in this chapter on the likelihood that such deviation will produce compensating or comparable results, adequate for the road uses and the welfare of the general public. The public works director or planning engineer will be the final authority resolving questions of fact in connection with standards for road construction not directly covered by this chapter.

Sec. 74-2 Road classification standards and level of service standards
I.
Road classifications and standards for all private roads, public roads that are not county roads, county roads maintained by others, and new county roads.
All roads that are existing, new private roads, public roads that are not county roads, county roads maintained by others or new county roads relied upon for access to their development shall meet the minimum standards in 74-1.IV, Table 74-2 below and section 74-4. The classifications and standards in this section account for current ADT in addition to the ADT expected to be generated by the development or use. If the classifications and standards in Table 74-2 are not met, the development shall make the improvements necessary to meet the standard or wait until the needed improvements are constructed by others. In addition to the classifications and standards in Table 74-2, the public works director may require additional improvements based on specific safety concerns including, but not limited to, road alignment, site distance and vehicle type generated by development. The road classifications and corresponding standards are:

II.
Level of service standards for existing county roads.
A.
Level of service standards apply to any existing county road that experiences an increase in traffic due to a development, from the project entrance to the nearest state highway, city or town road. If the LOS is not met, the development shall make the improvements necessary to meet the LOS standard or wait until the needed improvements are constructed by others.
B.
Exemptions for level of service standards. The following projects are exempt from LOS standards:
1.
Development regulated by chapter 90.
2.
Subdivisions in which all lots are greater than thirty-five (35) acres.
C.
In addition to the level of service standards, the public works director may require additional improvements to county roads based on specific safety concerns including, but not limited to, road alignment, site distance and vehicle type generated by development.
D.
Paved county roads. The county has established specified levels of service for all paved county roads. The established level of service ensures that the operating conditions a driver experiences while traveling on a paved county road are maintained within the acceptable ranges established by the board. The capacity of a paved county road is defined as the maximum traffic volume that can be accommodated at the adopted level of service and depends on road characteristics, such as number of lanes, lane widths, intersection geometry and signalization, as determined by the Transportation Research Board, Highway Capacity Manual. Except as noted in paragraph 74-2.II.B., all paved county roads that experience an increase in traffic due to a proposed development must:
1.
Function at LOS D in the joint planning area, or future growth boundaries of a town or city;
2.
Function at LOS C in all other areas;
3.
Have a minimum of a twenty (20) foot width.
E.
Exemptions for portions of paved county roads. The following roads are exempt from level of service standards:
1.
County Road 240 (Florida Road) from Whippoorwill Drive to County Road 250 (East Animas);
2.
County Road 251, also known as 32nd Street, from Holly Ave. to County Road 250 (East Animas);
3.
County Road 250 (East Animas) between County Road 251 and County Road 240;
4.
Other urbanized county roads, as determined by the public works director or planning engineer, that no longer meet the criteria for uninterrupted flow shall be evaluated for level of service as interrupted flow.
F.
Unpaved county roads. The established level of service for unpaved roads ensures the road can accommodate emergency vehicles and not negatively impact maintenance or air quality. All unpaved county roads that experience an increase in traffic due to a proposed development must:
1.
Have a total surface width of twenty (20) feet.
2.
Carry no more than four hundred (400) ADT after completion of the project. Asphalt paving or double pin chip seal, if structurally adequate, with adequate sub-base and base course material, is required when cumulative traffic volumes exceed these capacities for unpaved roads. Double pin chip seal may be allowed only to improve a road that, with the new development, meets the thresholds of a major local road with less than nine hundred ninety-nine (999) ADT.
3.
Be adequately surfaced with all-weather material to carry the weight of a sixty thousand (60,000) pound vehicle, minimum front single axle = 24,000 pounds; minimum rear single axle = 32,000 pounds.

Sec. 74-3 Review of development subject to this code
I.
Improvements required
. Applicants and owners are responsible for addressing and mitigating the road system impacts associated with their proposal as necessary to provide safe, efficient access to the development or use. This may include providing reasonable improvement to off-site transportation facilities made necessary by the development or use consistent with C.R.S. § 29-20-203.
A.
Auxiliary lanes. Where a development or use proposes to use an intersection that warrants auxiliary turn lanes, improvements for the auxiliary turn lanes shall be constructed by the owner.
B.
Existing roads. Whenever a proposed use or development impacts an existing road, including a county road, and the ability to maintain the functional classification, standards or safety of the road is impacted, the owner shall make on-site and off-site improvements to the existing road to address and mitigate the impacts associated with the use or development. The design and required improvements shall address all components and standards set forth in this chapter and shall be at the cost of the owner; provided, however, an applicant may seek reimbursement from subsequent development that utilizes the improvements when the conditions set forth in section 66-31 are satisfied. If the owner believes an existing private road, public road that is not a county road, or county road that is maintained by others conforms to these standards, the owner shall submit documentation illustrating such conformance and certification by a professional engineer that the road meets standards. The planning engineer may also require drawings of record to document conformance with the standards.
C.
New roads. When a development or use requires the design and construction of new public or private roadways, the design and required improvements shall address all components and standards set forth in this chapter and shall be at the cost of the owner.
D.
Extent of impacts. In satisfying the standards in this chapter for private roads, public roads that are not county roads, or county roads that are maintained by others, the development or use shall account for impacts and improvement from the farthest possible access point of the development or use to the connection with a county road, state highway or city or town road. In satisfying the standards in this chapter for county roads, developments or uses shall account for impacts from the proposed development or use to the nearest state highway or city or town road.
E.
Emergency or second primary access. If required by subsection 74-4.XIII, the owner shall construct emergency or second primary access.
F.
Improvements to state highways, if any, shall be determined by CDOT.

II.
Right-of-way management
.
A.
Both legal and physical access is required for purposes of developing a parcel. Legal access is the legal right vested in an owner to enter or return from a parcel to a public roadway without obstruction. Adjacency to a public road or private access with the legal right to cross constitutes adequate legal access. Physical improvements to a parcel by a road or driveway that meets the standards in this chapter constitute physical access. The review of and requirements for access depends upon the road classifications and level of service for the road to which the parcel connects.
B.
Right-of-way dedication.
1.
All roadways and streets located within the subject property, the benefit of which is to the current or future residents of the property, shall be dedicated as public rights-of-way unless specifically approved as private rights-of-way and so designated on the plat or exemption documents.
2.
In addition to any other dedication requirements, in some instances it may be necessary for a property owner to dedicate land to the county to maintain safe and efficient operation of transportation facilities. Unless otherwise specified below, Table 74-2 shall be deemed to establish the minimum right-of-way width for private roads, public roads that are not county roads, county roads maintained by others, new county roads and improvements to existing county roads.
a.
Adjacent to subject property. Prior to issuance of a land use permit or recordation of a plat, an owner shall convey to the county right-of-way adjacent to any county road, along the full length of the subject property, in accordance with the following:
i.
Width. The owner shall dedicate the minimum width of the right-of-way necessary to meet the county road width requirements set forth in the County Road Right of Way Widths document referenced in the appendix to section 81-6. County roads not listed in the appendix shall have a minimum width of sixty (60) feet. For properties that front the county road on one (1) side, half the minimum width is required to be dedicated. When the property fronts the county road on both sides, the full width is required to be dedicated.
ii.
Conveyance. The owner shall transfer fee simple title to the on-site right-of-way to the county by general warranty deed, unless the county attorney determines less than fee simple title or other form of deed is appropriate under the circumstances.
iii.
When dedication is required by this section and the resultant lot or parcel area becomes less than that required by law for a proposed development, that area of land so dedicated may be included in the calculation of the land area needed for the purpose of complying with the applicable law.
b.
Off-site dedications or conveyances for existing county roads. Whenever a proposed use or development impacts an existing county road, and the ability to maintain the functional classification, standards or safety of the road is affected due to insufficient right-of-way width and the standards in 74-4, the owner is required to obtain and transfer to the county additional right-of-way to offset the impacts of the development as follows:
i.
Width. The owner shall dedicate the minimum width of right-of-way for the improved road as set forth in the County Road Right of Way Widths document referenced in the appendix to section 81-6. County roads not listed in the appendix shall have a minimum width of sixty (60) feet. The public works director may allow dedication of a lesser width if it is determined that, along with adequate drainage and maintenance, a roadway meeting the standards may be constructed in the lesser width. Under no circumstances shall the public works director accept a right-of-way of less than thirty (30) feet.
ii.
Conveyance. The owner shall obtain the necessary right-of-way, at the owner’s cost, and transfer fee simple title to the off-site right-of-way to the county by general warranty deed, unless the county attorney determines less than fee simple title or other form of deed is appropriate under the circumstances.
c.
New and existing off-site private roads, public roads that are not county roads, and county roads maintained by others. Right-of-way widths for off-site private roads, public roads that are not county roads and county roads maintained by others impacted by the development shall meet the standards set forth in section 74-2 and the applicant shall obtain any additional rights-of-way necessary to comply with the standards of this chapter. Except for county roads maintained by others, right-of-way for these roads shall not be dedicated to or accepted by the county.
3.
When, due to topography, hazards or other design constraints, additional road width is necessary to provide for public safety and maintenance to contain all cut and fill areas, auxiliary lanes, drainage or other road appurtenances along roadways, then dedication of right-of-way in excess of the minimum standards shall be required. If only cut and fill slopes extend outside the minimum right-of-way, the public works director or planning engineer may allow permanent slope easements in lieu of additional right-of-way.
4.
In addition to dedication requirements, in some instances it may be preferable or necessary for a property owner to pay an in-lieu sum to the county for the right-of-way acquisition required for the physical improvements necessary to offset the impacts of the development.
C.
Roadway acceptance. All offers of dedication of public road right-of-way contained on or within any plat, plan, permit or other legal document setting forth a valid offer of dedication to the public are hereby accepted on behalf of the public. However, this acceptance on behalf of the public shall not be construed as accepting any obligation on the part of the county to maintain the accepted right-of-way nor shall the acceptance be construed as designating such public roads as county roads. County roads are as depicted on the official county road map. Rights-of-way for purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to, utility, path, road and railroad rights-of-way, easements, deeds or valid offers of conveyance of any kind.
This provision shall not be construed to alter, modify or rescind prior legal action taken by recorded resolution of the board accepting, rejecting or vacating any rights-of-way contained on or within any subdivision or land use plat, plan, permit or other legal document containing a valid offer of dedication.
D.
Acquisition. The board is authorized by state statute to layout, widen, alter or change any county road and to acquire land for county programs, projects or public purposes. The county may coordinate such acquisitions with owners when the acquisitions are for a valid public purpose. Acquisition of right-of-way shall substantially follow the Real Estate Acquisition Guide for Local Public Agencies published by the FHWA, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. Ch. 61, and Title 38 of the Colorado Revised Statutes.
III.
Process outline, submittals and completion.
A.
Process outline. Except for subdivisions where all lots are greater than thirty-five (35) acres and subject to the process set forth in section 74-6, the submittal requirements set forth in this section and review process shall follow the common review procedures described in sections 66-10 through 66-14. In those instances, the public works department is a referral agency under subsection 66-11.II in the development review process.
B.
Submittal requirements. The applicant or owner of the proposed use or development shall submit the following:
1.
A survey depicting all utilities, underground and above ground, and all significant topographical features. Surveys used to generate construction plans shall be based on a ground or aerial survey. GIS generated data shall not be used;
2.
A traffic analysis as described in subsection 74-3.IV;
3.
A description of how any safety concerns will be resolved, including access for emergency vehicles or other concerns expressed by the applicable fire district, if appropriate;
4.
Technical reports evaluating drainage, geotechnical, hydrological, structural and pavement design and other pertinent engineering issues deemed necessary by the public works director or planning engineer given the context;
5.
A description of any impact on ditches or ditch crossings;
6.
A description of the proposed mitigation for all adverse impacts to environmental and natural resources. For example, mitigation through an erosion control plan or a stormwater management plan;
7.
Identification of the party responsible for maintaining the road, including any existing or proposed agreements to manage maintenance of the facilities through a perpetual association, corporation or other suitable means;
8.
For all required improvements and facilities, construction plans meeting the minimum formatting and content requirements set forth in the construction plan guidance documents provided by the public works director or planning engineer and comporting with current industry standards. All construction plans shall be completed with enough detail to facilitate review and clearly describe the existing conditions and proposed construction of the development in its entirety and detail all existing equipment, infrastructure, and access. The required detail of construction plans, as determined by the planning engineer or public works director, shall depend upon the size, nature, and complexity of the use or development.
9.
If the public works director or planning engineer determine a proposed development or use may exceed the thresholds identified in section 74-2, the public works director may require, as a preliminary submittal, an opinion letter prepared and signed by a professional engineer addressing trip generation and potential impacts to determine if a traffic impact study under paragraph 74-3.IV.C is required.
10.
Snow storage calculations if the property is located over seven thousand five hundred (7,500) feet in elevation.
C.
Submittal process.
1.
Preliminary submittals. One (1) set of preliminary submittal items, in an electronic format, is required at project submittal. It may be necessary for the applicant to revise and resubmit these submittals based upon review and approval by the county.
2.
Final submittals. Prior to construction, the applicant shall submit final submittal items, with appropriate documents signed and sealed by a professional engineer for county approval.
3.
Revisions or updates to the approved documents. Revisions to the approved documents and supporting information shall be submitted to the CDD for approval prior to project completion. Revised construction plans shall show the clouded revisions and be signed and sealed by a professional engineer. If the public works director or planning engineer do not approve the changes, the applicant shall comply with the previously approved documents.
D.
Project completion. Except when a development improvements agreement is used, the applicant shall complete the improvements prior to plat recording or issuance of the land use permit. An inspection by the county shall be performed to verify that all improvements have been constructed, revegetation measures have been installed, and conditions of approval have been met. The owner shall also submit the following prior to inspection:
1.
Certification by a professional engineer that the improvements have been constructed in accordance with the approved construction plans;
2.
Certification by the owner that all improvements have been constructed in accordance with the approved construction plans;
3.
If deemed necessary or applicable by the planning engineer, approval of the improvements by applicable commenting agencies, fire departments or metropolitan districts.
IV.
Traffic analysis.
Because development and uses are responsible for addressing and mitigating their road system impacts, all proposed development and uses shall submit either a traffic evaluation under paragraph 74-3.IV.F or a traffic impact study under paragraph 74-3.IV.G, to inform staff and decision-making bodies about the development’s or use’s impacts on the roadway system as well as potential ways to mitigate those impacts. The public works director or planning engineer shall inform the applicant or owner of the level of analysis required during or subsequent to the pre-application meeting or after reviewing the opinion letter submitted pursuant to subparagraph 74-3.III.B.9. The public works director or planning engineer may ask for elements of a higher level of analysis where circumstances warrant.
A.
Exemptions. The planning engineer or public works director may waive a traffic analysis based on the following:
1.
Road improvements are not needed to accommodate the traffic to be generated by the project.
2.
The project takes direct access onto a city road or state highway. A second primary access onto a road that is not a city road or state highway will still require a traffic analysis for that portion of the traffic.
3.
The traffic to be generated does not adversely affect the traffic currently planned for and accommodated within, and adjacent to, the roadways, accesses, and intersections that provide access to the property; acceptable level of service on the adjacent public roadways, accesses, and intersections will be maintained; and no roadway, access, or intersection in the immediate vicinity has a history of safety or accident problems.
B.
The public works director or planning engineer may require traffic analysis to account for system impacts from approved development projects, phasing, or other projects in process concurrently with the county.
C.
The public works director or planning engineer may require an update to a previously submitted traffic analysis if there is an increase in background or project generated traffic or other factors that may impact traffic, level of service, or warrants for road improvements, since the original study was completed that may result in changes in level of service or the need for road improvements.
D.
Phased projects with a multi-year buildout will be required to prepare a master traffic analysis to address overall project impacts and identify key criteria that would warrant construction of road improvements. Unless exempted by paragraph 74-3.IV.A, each site specific development plan shall require a traffic analysis that verifies the accuracy of the original traffic projections, both on-site and background, and examines the warrants for road improvements.
E.
Projected traffic volumes. Both the traffic evaluation and the traffic impact study shall describe projected traffic volumes as follows:
1.
Trip generation values used for calculating ADT shall be primarily based on the type of occupancy for which the development is designed and secondarily based on the occupancy rate and activities generated. Subject to subparagraph 2 below, all uses shall use trip generation values as shown in the most current edition of the Trip Generation Manual, by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, or as verified by other data sources as determined by the public works director or planning engineer. When determining ADT under this subparagraph 1, primary consideration shall be given to the square footage of the proposed development and secondary consideration shall be given to other factors such as occupancy rate and the anticipated number of employees.
2.
For single-family use, multi-family use, and any nonresidential use not subject to subparagraph 1 above, trip generation values used for calculating ADT shall be as follows:

F.
Traffic evaluation. A traffic evaluation is required for projects that do not meet thresholds for a traffic impact study. The traffic evaluation shall:
1.
Quantify volume generated by the development or use
and determine internal road classifications
;
2.
If applicable, quantify off-site traffic volumes on a private road that provides access to a
county road
, state highway, city, or town road. Calculations shall account for future traffic from undeveloped lots at the single-family trip generation rate;
3.
Include entering sight distances for all intersections and accesses serving the project.
4.
Evaluate turn lane warrant based on CDOT Access Code and accounting for proposed and existing traffic volumes. For purposes of determining auxiliary lane warrants according to the current version of the Colorado State Highway Access Code, Volume 2, all county roads shall be considered category R-B unless the public works director determines other categories should be considered due to the densities of access points or because the proposed development or use is adjacent to an incorporated area.
G.
Traffic impact study.

Applicability. A traffic impact study involves a detailed analysis of road conditions, impacts and mitigation. Safety, access, level of service, and off-site impact mitigation are emphasized. A traffic impact study is required when the public works director or planning engineer determines the proposed development or use is anticipated to generate one (1) of the following:
a.
One hundred (100) or more ADT;
b.
A fifty (50) percent or more equivalent single axle load increase on the nearest county road caused by trucks classified by the United States Department of Transportation as Class 6 or higher;
c.
Additional traffic to an existing county road that currently operates, or with the increased traffic due to the development or use will operate, at a level of service less than that described in section 74-2;
d.
Additional traffic to any intersection with an existing peak hour traffic volume that is within ten (10) percent of meeting warrants for auxiliary lanes as determined by the current version of the Colorado State Highway Access Code, Volume 2;
e.
Any increased traffic volume at an intersection or on a roadway with a documented accident history or other known existing safety hazards, as determined by the public works director or planning engineer.
2.
Content requirements. All traffic impact studies shall:
a.
Quantify traffic volume generated by the project at build out and determine internal road classifications;
b.
Include a vicinity map;
c.
Meet the requirements of the current version of the Colorado State Highway Access Code, Volume 2;
d.
Study turning movements and level of service at peak hour for intersections adjacent to the proposed development or use;
e.
Study traffic within the traffic impact area, including turning movements and level of service at peak hour at intersections adjacent to the proposed development or use.
As determined by the planning engineer, the traffic impact area may be reduced or expanded depending on the traffic characteristics of the project, the existing and future land uses, and the road and traffic conditions that are affected by the project
;
f.
If applicable, quantify off-site traffic volumes on private roadways that provide access to a county road, state highway, city, or town road. Calculations shall account for future traffic from undeveloped lots at the single-family trip generation rate;
g.
Include modal split assumptions with analytical support;
h.
Include level of service calculations;
i.
Include entering sight distances for all intersections and accesses serving the project;
j.
Include warrants and design criteria for acceleration and deceleration lanes as required by the current versions of the Colorado State Highway Access Code, Volume 2 and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. For purposes of determining auxiliary lane warrants pursuant to the Colorado State Highway Access Code, Volume 2, all county roads shall be considered category R-B unless the public works director determines other categories should be considered due to the density of access points or because the proposed development is adjacent to an incorporated area;
k.
Include a safety analysis of potential conflict points, turning movements, road alignment, and five (5) years of accident history;
l.
Identify required roadway improvements, including without limitation road width and shoulders, geometry, acceleration and deceleration lanes, and turn lanes, drainage improvements, guardrail, signs, and striping;
m.
Include pavement structural capacity analysis based on a geotechnical study, unless the public works director determines the proposed development’s anticipated traffic represents less than a twenty-five (25) percent increase in ESAL loads;
n.
Identify road maintenance needs and schedule, including without limitation culverts and dust control;
o.
Collect existing traffic counts at the morning and afternoon peak hour traffic times over a minimum of two (2) weekdays, unless the public works director determines that such traffic counts are not needed based on the availability of existing data; traffic counts taken between October and April shall include a seasonal adjustment factor as calculated by CDOT for the region and time of year;
p.
Evaluate current daily peak and peak hour traffic data and twenty (20) year projections including without limitation turning movements at all intersections and key year midpoints assuming a build out of the traffic impact area based on land use, comprehensive plans, and growth estimates;
q.
Include data collection sheets, calculation sheets, and software outputs;
r.
Include a section for conclusions, mitigation and recommendations. This section should describe safety impacts resulting from the development or use, needed actions to mitigate the impacts (both immediately adjacent to the site as well as off-site mitigation measures needed as a direct result of the development or use), and the applicant’s proposed methods and schedule for phased projects to implement the mitigation measures. This section should detail the anticipated site access configuration (driveways, private roadways, paths, sidewalks, etc.) consistent with the requirements of these standards.

V.
Design exceptions
. Aside from LOS standards for existing
county roads
, in certain limited exceptions, it is recognized that a proposed design may deviate from the standards prescribed by the road design publications described in section 74-1 or elsewhere in this chapter. In such instances, the applicant’s or owner’s professional engineer shall document, in writing and with sufficient detail, the cause for such deviation. The rationale for the deviation shall demonstrate that the deviation satisfies all of the following:
A.
Is not likely to compromise public safety;
B.
Is not contrary to best engineering practices as reflected in the road design publications described in section 74-1 or elsewhere in this chapter;
C.
Is not contrary to the intent and general purposes of the code;
D.
Does not result in a significant impact to the public due to maintenance of the improvements;
E.
Is the minimum exception or deviation necessary to afford relief, given the context;
F.
Is reasonably necessary for the health, safety and welfare of the public.
Upon receipt of the written request, the public works director or planning engineer shall evaluate the rationale according to the criteria in this section and advise the applicant’s or owner’s professional engineer whether the deviation, in whole or in part, is acceptable.
If the applicant or owner do not agree with the determination of the public works director or planning engineer or the county attorney determines the request relates to special conditions or exceptional characteristics of the proposal, not created by the applicant, that may justify or require a variance from the strict and literal interpretation of this code’s standards to avoid undue hardship, the applicant or owner shall follow the variance process described in section 66-27.
VI.
Evaluation of development and use proposals.
A.
The following factors shall be considered when evaluating development or use proposals:
1.
Whether the proposal, design, proposed mitigation and construction plans meet the standards set forth in this chapter;
2.
Conformance with the road design publications described in subsection 74-1.III; provided, however, road widths for minor local roads shall be as set forth in this section 74-2;
3.
Whether the proposal will increase ESAL loads by fifty (50) percent or more, and whether the projected traffic loads from the development or use can be accommodated without damaging the roadway or increasing the county’s costs for maintenance;
4.
Whether there have been known safety issues including, but not limited to, road geometry, sight distance, number of accidents or need for emergency access;
5.
Whether the proposal adequately and appropriately mitigates the impacts (both immediately adjacent to the project as well as off-site mitigation measures needed as a direct result of the project), and whether the applicant’s or owner’s proposed methods and schedule for phasing is adequate to implement the mitigation measures.
B.
If the proposal does not meet the standards set forth in this chapter and no design modification would remedy the problems with the proposal, the planning engineer or public works director shall inform the director of such in the referral comments and articulate the specific standards that are not met.
C.
If the development proposal meets the requirements of this chapter but only by including recommended conditions of approval or specific plat notes, the planning engineer or public works director shall provide the necessary conditions of approval or plat notes to the director.
D.
Once submitted to the director, the referral agency comments shall become part of the permanent record and incorporated into the project file. The referral comments shall inform the CDD’s recommendation for project approval or denial to the decision-making body.

Any person, municipality, quasi-municipal agencies, electric, gas or communication utility corporation, to include cable TV, who, without first having obtained a county road right-of-way permit or who, having made a cut in any county road right-of-way which has settled, has failed, or which has not been repaired in conformance with established county standards, shall be subject to a stop work order issued by the public works department. Once a stop work order is issued, the person, municipality or utility shall, except for emergency repair work, discontinue all work within the county road right-of-way until such time as the required repair has been satisfactorily completed, and no further permits will be issued until the repair has been made or the county reimbursed for its expenses. The county may, on its own initiative, make required repairs and bill the responsible party. The minimum charge shall be an administrative charge listed in appendix A of this code, plus reasonable costs for labor, materials and equipment on a portal to portal basis.
K.
Priority of utilities
1.
.Due to the limited capacity of county owned right-of-way, the board has prioritized public utilities over private utilities when using county rights-of-way for parallel installation. The following are exempted from the general priority of this paragraph K:
a.
Crossings by a private utility, as opposed to requests for parallel installation;
b.
Maintenance, repair or replacement of pre-existing pipelines.
2.
Procedure and evaluation.
a.
In determining whether a permit shall be issued to a private utility, the public works director shall evaluate the maximum capacity of the right-of-way to accommodate the present and expected installation and operation of lines and facilities intended to distribute utilities and telecommunications products to end-users of such products and to also accommodate such other pipelines, wires, cable and any other facilities that any other private or public entity may install and operate in such right-of-way. Consideration shall also be given to future road improvement projects.
b.
If the public works director determines approving the permit will adversely affect future road improvement projects or would occupy such capacity in the right-of-way that it would likely prevent the expected reasonable and necessary future expansion of utility distribution lines and facilities in the right-of-way, the public works director may deny the permit application.
c.
A permit may be approved by the public works director where the applicant demonstrates there is no practical alternative route or that the alternative route(s) would not be in the best interest of the public, including without limitation consideration of environmental degradation, destruction of wetlands or adverse impacts to cultural resources.
II.
Road improvement agreements.
Significant work, as determined by the public works director, performed in a county road right-of-way, as part of a land use permit or otherwise, shall require a road improvement agreement between the county and the party performing the improvements. The board has approved a standardized road improvement agreement. The public works director, with the assistance of the county attorney, may negotiate amendments to the standardized road improvement agreement; however, any amended road improvement agreement must be presented to the board for approval.
III.
Cattle guards permits.
A.
Permit required. No person shall install, construct or remove a cattle guard in a county right-of-way without first obtaining a permit from the public works department.
B.
Procedure and evaluation.
1.
Application and inspection. The public works director shall review all applications for installation of a cattle guard on a county road, inspect the site, and may, if necessary, request further relevant information from the applicant. Design of the cattle guard shall be based on CDOT’s specifications for cattle guards. The public works director may deny the application if the installation of the cattle guard would be detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of the public, or would adversely affect the flow of traffic or maintenance of the county road.
2.
Construction. Construction of the cattle guard shall conform to the plans submitted to and approved by the public works director. All construction must comply with the terms and conditions of the revocable license to perform work in the county right-of-way.

c.
A
person
who directly benefits from a cattle guard on a
county road
may request that the
county

public works director
shall use discretion in whether to clean the debris or repair the cattle guard at the
county
's expense or direct the permittee of the cattle guard to complete such cleaning or repair at such party’s expense.
4.
Removal.
a.
A permittee for installation of a cattle guard or a permittee’s successors or assigns generally responsible for cleaning and repair pursuant to subparagraph B.3 above, or a person benefitting from a cattle guard on a county road may request removal of the cattle guard. The person requesting removal shall provide notice of the proposed action in writing to all parties benefiting from the cattle guard. Such notice shall be sent by certified U.S. mail and shall state that comments may be provided to the public works director within fifteen (15) days of receipt. If the cattle guard no longer serves a public benefit, as determined in the sole discretion of the public works director, the public works director may grant removal. If the public works director authorizes the removal, the cattle guard shall be removed at the requesting party’s expense.
b.
A permit to construct a cattle guard shall not create a vested property right, and the county, in the public works director's sole discretion, may remove a cattle guard in a county road after mailing written notice of removal to the parties benefitting from the cattle guard. Such notice shall be mailed at least fifteen (15) days prior to commencement of the removal. If such cattle guard is removed by the county, the removal shall be at the county's expense.

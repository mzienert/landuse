CHAPTER 66: PERMITS AND PROCEDURES
Overview
This chapter describes the common procedures for
county
review of all land development activity in the
unincorporated
areas of La Plata County and the specific procedures for the review of
land use permits
and other types of applications.
The provisions common to all permit and
development
review covered in this chapter include, among other things, pre-application procedures, submittal requirements, public notice, scope of
county
review, public meetings and appeals.
This chapter also includes the unique procedural review requirements or steps for most individual types of
land use permit
applications and the rules that will apply to an application once it is approved, such as the life of the
development
approval, expiration, and amendments.
The specific procedural steps for divisions of land are in chapter 67 and for
planned unit developments
in chapter 68.
Sec. 66-31 Fair share reimbursement for improvements
I.
Purpose.
The purpose of fair share reimbursement is to assist developers who are required by the county to install or construct public improvements as a condition of the land use permit by allowing the developer to recover some of their costs from subsequent developers whose property is likely to make use of such improvements. This section establishes the standards and procedures to receive fair share reimbursement pursuant to the authority specifically conferred by C.R.S. § 30-28-133(12) and more generally by C.R.S. §§ 30-28-101
et seq.
and C.R.S. §§ 29-20-101
et seq.
II.
Applicability.
An applicant for one (1) of the following land use permits may simultaneously seek approval of fair share reimbursement for any public improvement required by the county that is estimated to cost more than three hundred thousand (300,000) dollars:
A.
Major subdivisions under section 67-3;
B.
Manufactured home subdivisions under section 73-15;
C.
Planned unit developments under chapter 68 which include a major subdivision under section 67-3;
D.
The creation of condominiums, townhome dwellings and other forms of airspace ownership or air-right subdivisions as described and defined in C.R.S. § 38-33-101
et seq.
III.
Procedure and approval criteria for applying for fair share reimbursement.
A.
Timing of submittals.
1.
If a public improvement is identified as a potential requirement during the pre-application process, an applicant who wants to pursue fair share reimbursement must include the submittals required by this section for the application to be deemed complete and ready for agency referral pursuant to subsection 66-11.II.
2.
If a public improvement is identified as a requirement as a result of the agency referral or staff compliance review processes identified in subsection 66-11.II., an applicant who wants to pursue fair share reimbursement must provide the submittals required by this section before proceeding with the next step in the application process.
B.
Submittals. An applicant requesting fair share reimbursement for the costs of any improvement shall submit to the director a proposed cost recovery statement for each improvement. This section contemplates the possibility that there may be multiple cost recovery statements per land use permit, but under no circumstances shall an applicant be entitled to submit more than one (1) proposed cost recovery statement for a single improvement. The applicant shall submit the following items as part of the proposed cost recovery statement:
1.
A clear description and drawing of the improvement;
2.
An itemized statement, with supporting documentation for each item, of the estimated costs of the improvement. For purposes of a subsequent performance guarantee required by the county, the estimated costs of an improvement shall be the amount determined by the director necessary to guarantee funds for the completion of the improvement at the time of the recording of the final plat for the original developer's subdivision or the issuance of a land use permit, with any percentage of overage (i.e., contingency) required by the county added after such adjustment to the estimated costs;
3.
A statement, report, or study, including any data in support thereof, prepared or certified by a professional engineer, that expresses the maximum capacity of the improvement, the estimated usage of the improvement incurred by the proposed development at its maximum capacity, the net remaining capacity of the improvement after subtracting the maximum usage expected by the proposed development and the expected lifespan of the improvement, all in quantitative terms generally accepted by professionals in the relevant area of expertise and in conformance with any procedures maintained by the county. Such statement, report or study shall also include a calculation that relates the quantitative measurements of capacity to a dollar cost per unit. For example, in the case of a street, the amount should generally be expressed in terms of dollar cost per average daily trip or similar terms;
4.
A list and map of all properties, identified by parcel number, that the applicant proposes should be subject to fair share reimbursement as potentially benefitted properties, together with a scaled drawing establishing the location of the relevant improvement in relation to these properties. For all such potentially benefitted properties, an applicant shall provide a list of the names and mailing addresses of the owners based on the most current records of the county assessor's office;
5.
An explanation describing how each potentially benefitted property is either adjacent to the improvement or will have presumed use of the improvement such that any fair share reimbursement that may be required for the development of such property shall comply with the requirements of C.R.S. §§ 29-20-203, 30-28-133(12) and the United States and Colorado Constitutions;
6.
A statement proposing the duration of the reimbursement period, as well as supporting rational for the proposed duration based on the expected life and capacity of the improvement throughout the proposed reimbursement period. The proposed duration shall not exceed fifteen (15) years from the date of completion of an improvement.
C.
Director’s review. The director shall review the proposed cost recovery statement to make a preliminary determination that it is complete to accept for review. The director has the authority and the discretion to require an applicant to provide updates, revisions, clarifications, or supplementary materials that the director determines are necessary for the initial review. At any time during this review, the applicant may amend the proposed cost recovery statement either of its own volition or pursuant to any request from the director. Subject to the timing of submittals in paragraph 66-31.III.A. above, an application shall not proceed to the next step of the review and public meeting process until the director determines the submittals required by this section are compliant. Thereafter, any staff report to the planning commission or board shall include a recommendation of approval, approval with conditions, or denial of fair share reimbursement.
D.
Notice to potentially benefitted property owners.
1.
If the director determines that a neighborhood meeting is appropriate, the notice required by section 66-11.IV. for neighborhood meetings shall, in addition to any recipients required by section 66-14, include the owners of all potentially benefitted property. In addition to any other information required in the notice by section 66-14, it shall include a narrative of the improvement, estimated cost, and statement that a copy of the proposed cost recovery statement may be obtained from the director. Such notice shall also inform the potentially benefitted property owner that they have the right to send written comments on the proposed cost recovery statement to the director and may comment at any public meeting on the approval of the cost recovery statement. Thereafter, any notices required by this code to be sent to surrounding owners shall include the owners of all potentially benefitted property as well as then-current versions of all materials required by this subparagraph 66-31.III.D.1.
2.
If no neighborhood meeting is held, or if the timing of the fair share reimbursement submittals is after the neighborhood meeting, all notices required by this code to be sent to surrounding owners shall include the owners of potentially benefitted property as well as the then-current versions of all materials required by subparagraph 66-31.III.D.1. above.
3.
Fair share reimbursement shall not be approved without at least one (1) public meeting pursuant to subsection 66-12.II. and without public notice pursuant to section 66-14. All descriptions of the project in public notices shall include the applicant’s intent to request fair share reimbursement pursuant to this section.
E.
Payment of administrative fee for processing of cost recovery statement. Prior to any meeting that is scheduled for the consideration of final approval of a land use permit for which fair share reimbursement is being requested, the applicant shall submit to the county an administrative processing fee equal to the actual costs incurred by the county in staff time and consulting fees in evaluating the proposed cost recovery statement. This fee shall be charged to reimburse the county for the costs of administering and processing the proposed cost recovery statement and shall be nonrefundable, regardless of fair share reimbursement approval. The county may also charge a fee to reimburse the county for the costs of administering a development application for a secondary developer subject to a fair share reimbursement.
F.
Recording of notice of fair share reimbursement. As soon as practicable after the issuance of a land use permit that includes an approved fair share reimbursement, the original developer shall prepare and submit to the county clerk and recorder for recording a notice of fair share reimbursement in the chain of title for each approved benefitted property in a form approved by the county attorney. Recording of the notice of fair share reimbursement is merely a statement that a unique government land use regulation may apply to a property. The notice is not a lien or any other type of encumbrance on the chain of title for said property. Such notice shall include the original developer's mailing address and specify the approved reimbursement period and that the fair share reimbursement may be amended. The notice shall also specify that it shall automatically expire at such time without filing of a release. The approved version of the cost recovery statement shall be attached to the recorded notice. Because the initial right to fair share reimbursement is approved prior to completion of the improvement, the original developer or its successor in interest must record an amended notice, with an amended cost recovery statement approved pursuant to paragraph 66-31.III.G. below, in the property records after completion of the improvement. The amended notice shall identify the final cost, the date the improvement was completed and the ending date of the reimbursement period and shall attach the approved amended cost recovery statement. The right to receive fair share reimbursement runs with the land that was subject to the land use permit that included an approved right to fair share reimbursement.
G.
After completion of the improvement, an original developer must amend the cost recovery statement to include the final and actual costs of the improvement. The amended cost recovery statement shall be submitted to the director and may be approved administratively by the director. As-built drawings and documentation shall be provided for each item to support the actual costs and completed improvement. If the director believes that the amended cost recovery statement is significantly different from the original, the director may place such amended cost recovery statement on the board’s agenda for consideration.
IV.
Approval criteria
. Fair share reimbursement shall only be approved as part of a land use permit if the decision-making body determines that all approval criteria are satisfied. In reviewing a proposed cost recovery statement, a review body and a decision-making body shall consider the following approval criteria:
A.
The estimated costs are reasonable in light of the nature of the improvement and prevailing market rates;
B.
The improvement confers a public benefit;
C.
All proposed potentially benefitted properties are either adjacent to or will have presumed use of the improvement if the potentially benefitted property is developed in the future;
D.
The reimbursement period is reasonable in light of the nature of the improvement, the amount of excess capacity available for use by potentially benefitted properties, and the expected life-span of the improvement.
V.
Procedure for payment of fair share reimbursement.
A.
Rebuttable presumption. The recording of a notice of fair share reimbursement pursuant to this section following issuance of a land use permit that includes the right to fair share reimbursement creates a rebuttable presumption that the owner of the benefitted property owes a fair share of the costs of the subject improvement to the owner of record of the property that was subject to the land use permit that included the right to fair share reimbursement, if:
1.
The owner of the benefitted property submits an application for a land use permit (or conducts any development for which a land use permit was required, even if no permit was pursued) related to such benefitted property;
2.
The reimbursement period had not expired at the time of the activity identified in 1 above.
B.
Payment of fair share reimbursement.
1.
If a secondary developer submits an application for a land use permit related to benefitted property, such application shall not be a complete application until the secondary developer submits a statement, report or study, including any data in support thereof, prepared or certified by a professional engineer, that expresses the estimated usage of the improvement incurred by the proposed development at its maximum capacity, all in quantitative terms generally accepted by professionals in the relevant area of expertise and consistent with the units of measurement used in the approved cost recovery statement and any procedures maintained by the county.
2.
The owner of record of the original developer’s property that was subject to the land use permit that included the right to fair share reimbursement shall receive written notice of the secondary development.
a.
If the director determines that a neighborhood meeting is appropriate, the notice required by subsection 66-11.IV. for neighborhood meetings shall, in addition to any recipients required by section 66-14, include the owner of record of the original developer’s property. In addition to any other information required in the notice by section 66-14, it shall include a narrative of the proposed development and a copy of the cost recovery statement, report or study that identifies its proposed use and fair share reimbursement. Such notice shall also inform the owner of record of the original developer’s property that they have the right to send written comments on the proposed fair share reimbursement to the director and may comment at any public meeting on the approval of the proposed development. Thereafter, any notices required by this code to be sent to surrounding owners shall include the owner of record of the original developer’s property.
b.
If no neighborhood meeting is held, or if the timing of the fair share reimbursement submittals is after the neighborhood meeting, all notices required by this code to be sent to surrounding owners shall include the owner of record of the original developer’s property and shall include the then-current versions of the materials required by sub-subparagraph 66-31.IV.B.2.a. above.
3.
Payment of obligation required before recording of final plat or issuance of land use permit. If the decision-making body approves or conditionally approves the secondary developer’s development, the secondary developer shall not record a final plat or receive a land use permit until the secondary developer:
a.
Tenders, or attempts in good faith to tender, good funds in full to the owner of record of the original developer’s property in the amount established by the decision-making body;
b.
Provides adequate proof to the director in a form acceptable to the county that such funds have either been paid or that a good faith effort has been made by the secondary developer to deliver the funds. For the purposes of attempting to tender such funds, the secondary developer shall be determined to have acted in good faith if they have attempted to contact the owner of record of the original developer’s property at the last address listed in the assessor’s records for the original developer’s property as well as the address listed on the most recent notice of fair share reimbursement recorded in the chain of title of the subject property.
c.
Alternative payment. Nothing in this section may be construed to prohibit an original developer and a secondary developer from entering into a private agreement for the recovery by the original developer of all or part of the costs for any particular improvement. However, any such agreement renders an original developer ineligible to seek fair share reimbursement from such secondary developer for the benefitted property pursuant to this section for the relevant improvement. If a private agreement is made with respect to alternative payment of fair share reimbursement, as soon as practicable thereafter the owner of record of the original developer’s property shall record a notice of release of fair share reimbursement indicating that the property is no longer subject to any recovery of fair share reimbursement under this section and provide a copy of the same to the director.

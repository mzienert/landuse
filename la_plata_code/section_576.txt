The Board of County Commissioners may adopt resolutions restricting the long-term access of any county road, pursuant to this section, as amended from time to time, as determined necessary to preserve public health, safety and welfare of residents and travelling public. The

be determined as follows:
I.
The

right-of-way
drainage or to protect the functional level of the county road.
II.
The board shall hold at least one public hearing to consider and take testimony as to the proposed restriction(s).
III.
The necessity of the restriction(s) shall be reviewed on an annual basis.
IV.
When appropriate, the county engineer
may
recommend or the board may require that a road repair and maintenance agreement be entered into to maintain a minimal functional level of the road or to prevent further deterioration.
V.
The board shall make a formal finding that the restrictions are necessary and subject to the board's reasonable police powers.
Failure to adhere to long-term restrictions on access to a county road shall be considered a traffic infraction, as set forth in Article V of Chapter 54 of the Code.

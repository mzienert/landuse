DIVISION 3. FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
Sec. 78-72. General standards.
In all
special flood hazard areas
, the following provisions are required for all
new construction
and
substantial improvements
. In determining compliance with this section, available
base flood elevation
data
shall
be utilized.
I.
Anchoring.
A.
All new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
B.
All manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring
may
include, but are not limited to,
use
of over-the-top and frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. Specific requirements shall be that:
1.
Over-the-top ties are provided at each of the four corners of the
manufactured home
with two additional ties per side at intermediate locations, with manufactured homes less than 50 feet long requiring one additional tie per side;
2.
Frame ties are provided at each corner of the home with five additional ties per side at intermediate points, with manufactured homes less than 50 feet long requiring four additional ties per side;
3.
All components of the anchoring system shall be capable of carrying a force of 4,800 pounds; and
4.
Any additions to the manufactured home shall be similarly anchored.
II.
Construction
materials and methods.
A.
All new construction and/or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and
utility
equipment
resistant to
flood
damage.
B.
All new construction and substantial improvements, including manufactured homes, shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
C.
All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service
facilities
that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
III.
Utilities.
A.
All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
B.
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters.
C.
Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
D.
Plumbing opening into areas required to be flood proofed shall be equipped with backwater valves, as provided in the plumbing
code
.
E.
Electrical wiring shall be entirely within the flood proofed space. The electrical service and meter shall be above the
base flood
level in a location approved by the serving utility.
IV.
Subdivision
and other
development
proposals.
A.
All subdivision proposals, including the placement of
manufactured home parks
and subdivisions, shall be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision or other development proposal is in a flood-prone area, the proposal shall minimize flood damage.
B.
All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
C.
All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
D.
Base flood elevation data shall be generated and provided for all subdivision proposals or other development proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which contain at least 50
lots
or five acres, whichever is less, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 78-23 or 78-51 of this chapter.
E.
All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, must obtain a
floodplain development permit
in accordance with section 78-33 by submitting an application pursuant to the requirements of section 78-52, and satisfy the applicable provisions of division 3 of this chapter. No
building
sites
shall be approved in any determined floodway area.
F.
Any contemplated floodway encroachment or channeling shall be thoroughly analyzed and its effect on stream flow determined before it is undertaken. No encroachment of a floodway area shall be allowed that would result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of a base flood.

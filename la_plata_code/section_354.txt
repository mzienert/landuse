IX.
License duration.
Unless duly revoked or suspended, renewed licenses shall run concurrently with the license renewed by the MED. This means that such license will expire on the same date as the current state license.

Furthermore, the licensee agrees to investigate, handle, respond to, and to provide defense for and defend against, any such liability, claims, or demands at its expense, and to bear all other costs and expenses related thereto, including court costs and attorney fees; however, such agreement does not make the licensee an agent or employee of the county.

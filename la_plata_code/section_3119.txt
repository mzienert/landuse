Chapter 74: Road and Bridge Standards and Permits
Sec. 74-4 Roadway and sign design and construction standards
I.
Design speed.
C.R.S. § 42-4-1102 requires that speed limits not be higher or lower than those prescribed by state statute unless the investigation or considerations required by the statute justify the change. The public works director or planning engineer may reduce a design speed and may require more stringent widths and grades from those set forth in Table 74-2 if such changes are warranted by topography, cross-section, drainage, snow storage, maintenance or other site-specific conditions.
II.
Turnouts
. Turnouts shall be provided at fire hydrants for all low ADT and minor local roads. Required turnouts shall be sixty (60) feet (including tapers) in length and provide twenty-six (26) feet in total surface width of cross-section with reasonable tapering.
III.
Physical or geological constraints.
Where physical or geological constraints limit road improvements, the surface width of arterial and collector roads may be reduced by the public works director to twenty-two (22) feet if the specified shoulder width is met, and the posted speed limit is forty-five (45) miles per hour or less. If the arterial or collector road is an urban road with urban improvements, including curb, gutter, and sidewalks, and has a posted speed of thirty-five (35) miles per hour or less, the surface width may be reduced by the public works director to twenty-one (21) feet if the paved shoulders will be five (5) feet in width or greater.
IV.
Shoulder width
. The shoulder widths in Table 74-2 shall be required on both sides of the travel way width sections of the roadway and shall be at the same grade as the road surface.
V.
Cut and fill slope
.
A.
Cut and fill slopes shall be completely contained within the right-of-way. If insufficient right-of-way exists, additional width shall be obtained as prescribed by subsection 74-3.II.
B.
The preferred design for cut slopes shall be four (4) foot horizontal to one (1) foot vertical. Cut slopes shall not be greater (steeper) than two (2) foot horizontal to one (1) foot vertical and ten (10) feet high except for cuts in stable bedrock verified by a professional engineer. The preferred design for fill slopes shall be four (4) foot horizontal to one (1) foot vertical. Fill slopes shall not be greater (steeper) than two (2) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical and four (4) feet high. A slope that exceeds the minimum cut or fill requirements shall either be certified as stable in its current finished state by a professional engineer or shall be designed by a professional engineer.
VI.
Superelevation
. Maximum superelevation rate shall be six hundredths (.06) feet/foot. The public works director or planning engineer may require a lower superelevation rate based on safety considerations. Factors informing the need for superelevation include climate conditions, terrain conditions, classification of the road and the frequency of slow-moving vehicles on the roadway.
VII.
Parking areas
. For projects that have a defined parking area, these standards shall apply from the road to the beginning of the surface widening for the parking area. These standards shall not apply within designated parking areas.
VIII.
Intersections
.
A.
Intersections should be designed to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other site conditions justify variations. A minimum angle of intersection of roads shall be sixty (60) degrees.
B.
Sight distances at intersections shall meet the Colorado State Highway Access Code (Volume 2, Code of Colorado Regulations 601-1, latest edition) minimum standards and the applicable road design publications described in subsection 74-1.III. Intersections including median openings shall be designed with adequate corner sight distance and kept free of obstacles.
C.
No fence, wall, entrance fixture, landscaping, tree or other sight obstruction shall be allowed to encroach upon the required sight distance at intersections.

E.
The gradient for roads less than four hundred (400) ADT shall not exceed five (5) percent for the portion of the road within sixty (60) feet of an intersection, measured from the travel way. The gradient for all other roads shall not exceed five (5) percent for the portion of the road within one hundred (100) feet of an intersection, measured from the travel way.
F.
Corner radii at all intersections shall be a minimum twenty (20) feet in residential areas and forty (40) feet in industrial or commercial areas, as determined by the public works director.
G.
Design of auxiliary lanes shall conform to the current version of the Colorado State Highway Access Code. Designs also shall address right-of-way, guardrail, signing, and striping. The public works director may require additional construction requirements such as sawcutting, milling, and overlay of the asphalt be incorporated into the design to ensure the long term integrity of the pavement.
IX.
Surfacing requirements
.
A.
All roads in a subdivision having a net density greater than three (3) units per acre shall be paved or double pin chip seal surfaced in accordance with the design standards set forth in the current CDOT Pavement Design Manual.

I.
A professional engineer shall certify that the design and construction of the turnaround area can accommodate the safe turnaround of an AASHTO design vehicle WB-40, and a minimum of fifty (50) feet in length.
II.
Gates
. Gated subdivision roads and accesses may be considered within a project when both the applicable fire district and public works director approve the gate’s design. Gate design shall account for public safety for pull-outs along travel lanes and effective accessibility for emergency vehicles through use of a Knox Box or other uniform devices or method.
III.
Road structure design and testing standards
.
A.
The following standards apply to major local, collector, and arterial classified roads and may apply to minor local and low ADT classified roads as determined by the public works director or planning engineer. The costs of structure design and testing shall be at the sole cost of the owner.

C.
All developments above seven thousand five hundred (7,500) feet mean sea level shall provide adequate snow storage areas equivalent to twenty-five (25) percent of the paved or gravel surface adjacent to the traveled way, which may include shoulders and borrow ditches. Uphill grades of five (5) to ten (10) percent shall count at seventy-five (75) percent of the areas to satisfy this requirement. Uphill grades of eleven (11) to twenty (20) percent shall count at fifty (50) percent of the area to satisfy this requirement. Steep uphill grades greater than twenty (20) percent are not appropriate for snow stacking and shall not be counted to satisfy this requirement. More intense developments may incorporate snow melt systems or haul snow to suitable snow storage areas. Snow storage areas shall be analyzed to ensure that facilities are in place to protect wetlands, streams and rivers from runoff. Any additional areas needed outside the right-of-way must be included in a snow storage easement. Calculations prepared by a professional engineer shall be submitted and snow storage for areas shall be shown on the construction plans.
VIII.
Access road culverts
.
A.
Installation of culverts along county roads. When the installation of a culvert is made necessary by the creation or expansion of access from private property to a county road, by any alteration of the natural flow of water across private property, or any other reason necessitated by the actions of an owner of property adjacent to a county road, the owner shall pay for materials and the cost of installation for the new culverts. A permit shall be obtained for any work in the right-of-way and approval by the public works director as to specifications, size and location in the county right-of-way is required prior to installation. The culvert size shall be determined in accordance with standard engineering practices. The minimum culvert size is fifteen (15) inches in diameter and acceptable materials include corrugated metal, concrete and polyethylene.
B.
Maintenance. After installation, the property owner shall maintain and repair the road access, culvert and associated borrow ditch to the extent necessary to accommodate proper drainage. If the county notifies the owner of the need for maintenance or repair of the culvert, the owner shall have fifteen (15) days to make such repair or perform the needed maintenance. If the owner fails to perform the maintenance or performs the repair or maintenance inadequately, the county may perform the repair or maintenance as necessary to protect the county road and related appurtenances within the right-of-way. The county may charge the owner for the costs incurred. In an emergency or hazardous situation, the owner shall be notified and requested to provide an immediate remedy to the situation. If the property owner fails to react promptly, the county may correct the hazardous situation and charge the property owner for all costs incurred by the county.

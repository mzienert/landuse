Overview
The specific uses addressed in this chapter require particular attention for a variety of reasons. Although many uses have the potential to impact neighbors by generating noise, dust, odor, light, traffic or other potential nuisances, some uses require evaluation and mitigation efforts beyond those established more generally elsewhere in the code. By way of example, some uses present additional concerns to the health, safety and welfare of the community at large that justify special attention in this chapter. Other uses addressed in this chapter warrant special attention in order to accommodate unique technical considerations or to coordinate the county’s interests with regulations and standards set at the state and federal levels. Some uses addressed in this chapter present opportunities to promote the county’s interest in the use by allowing different standards than those generally applicable.
Sec. 73-1 Applicability
The standards and submittal requirements set forth in this chapter are in addition to all other applicable standards and submittal requirements set forth in this code. However, the director may waive or modify one (1) or more of the submittal requirements of this chapter or chapter 66 when the submitted information would be duplicative or not relevant to a determination whether the project complies with all applicable criteria for approval.

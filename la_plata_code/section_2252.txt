ARTICLE IV. - TRANSFERS OF 06CW99 WATER RIGHT INCREMENTS
Sec. 94-48. - Deeds.
Issuing deeds. After a
water user
submits a written request for a deed and provides to the planning
director
a copy of a water court decree making an
increment
an
absolute water right
, the
county
shall convey by quitclaim deed that increment to the water user. The planning director shall be authorized to sign such deeds on behalf of the county, but such deeds shall be satisfactory in form and content to the county attorney. The planning director shall sign and issue the deeds in the same order that the written requests are received.
Abandonment. Deeds issued pursuant to subsection (I) above shall specifically provide that it is the intent of both the county and the water user to create a conditional fee interest in the water user and a right of entry in the county, meaning that a deeded increment is conveyed to the water user upon the condition that the
board of county commissioners
does not reasonably determine by resolution that the increment is at risk of being abandoned. If such a resolution is adopted, the deed shall specify that the water user consents to the county filing an action to quiet title and retake the increment. Any increment appearing on any abandonment list prepared by a division engineer pursuant to C.R.S. § 37-92-401 and C.R.S. § 37-92-402 shall create a rebuttable presumption that the increment is at risk of being abandoned.

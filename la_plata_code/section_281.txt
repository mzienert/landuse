DIVISION 2. INVESTMENT POLICY
FOOTNOTE(S):
Editor's note—
Res. No. 2014-36, § 5(Exh. A), adopted October 14, 2014, amended division 2 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, division 2 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Res. No. 2012-21, § 5(Exh. A), adopted October 14, 2012, and Res. No. 2014-04, § 1, adopted January 7, 2014.
Sec. 2-764. Prudence.
The standard of prudence to be used for managing the
county
's assets is the "prudent investor" rule, which states that a prudent investor "
shall
exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the
management
of the property of another, not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of capital." (C.R.S. § 15-1-304, Standard for Investments.)
The county's overall investment program shall be designed and managed with a degree of professionalism that is worthy of the public trust. The county recognizes that no investment is totally without risk and that the investment activities of the county are a matter of public record. Accordingly, the county recognizes that occasional measured losses
may
occur in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall portfolio's return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented and that the sale of a security is in the best long-term interest of the county.
The county treasurer and other authorized
persons
acting in accordance with written procedures and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes.

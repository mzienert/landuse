Overview
This chapter describes the common procedures for
county
review of all land development activity in the
unincorporated
areas of La Plata County and the specific procedures for the review of
land use permits
and other types of applications.
The provisions common to all permit and
development
review covered in this chapter include, among other things, pre-application procedures, submittal requirements, public notice, scope of
county
review, public meetings and appeals.
This chapter also includes the unique procedural review requirements or steps for most individual types of

Relationship with other requirements and procedures
I.
Compliance with other regulations.
Except as otherwise provided, compliance with this

Coordinated review and permitting.
Any
applicant
for a permit under this chapter that is also subject to the regulations of other state or federal agencies may request that the
county

county
will coordinate its approval of the application, including the terms and conditions of such approval, with that of other agencies.

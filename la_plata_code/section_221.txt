The purpose of the WAC is to act in an advisory capacity to the

county
. The WAC
may
make recommendations to the BOCC concerning positions on issues of importance to the county, but may not take any positions itself. The duties and responsibilities of the WAC are as follows:
I.
Consider, analyze and answer the following five specific questions:
A.
Should La Plata County be concerned about our local water resources because of: (1) lack of water supplies, (2) lack of water infrastructure or (3) inefficiencies in the current water systems?
B.
Should La Plata County operate "water docks?" If so, where should those "water docks" be located?
C.
If La Plata County purchases water from the Animas - La Plata
Project
, how should the purchased water be used?
D.
Concerning "proof of water" for central water systems, should the La Plata County
Code
be minimally amended to conform with State statutes or should it be amended to require more than the minimum requirements established by State statutes?
E.
Will a County-wide ground water hydrological study: (1) tell the
community
anything we do not already know, or (2) be the best
use
of La Plata County's limited fiscal resources?
II.
Make recommendation to the BOCC with respect to any of the issues it considers, as appropriate; and
III.
Review any specific matters submitted to it for consideration and perform such other functions as prescribed by the BOCC.

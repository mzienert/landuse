Sec. 81-3 Transitional rules
I.
Existing nonconforming uses or structures
. All uses or structures legally established on the effective date that do not comply with this code shall be considered pre-existing nonconforming uses or structures and shall be permitted to continue to the extent provided in the provisions of chapter 79.
II.
Legal lots of record.
No further land use permit shall be required for the sale or conveyance of any legal lot of record existing on the effective date. However, any new use, change in use or the extension or alteration of the scope of an existing use on any legal lot of record existing on the effective date shall be in conformance with all provisions of this code, including chapter 79.
III.
Compliance with permit conditions
. Unless subject to the exceptions in C.R.S. § 24-68-105, all development approved and permitted prior to the effective date shall be completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the land use permit approval, including all terms, conditions, and regulations governing the issuance of the land use permit and according to the land use code provisions in effect at vesting. Terms, conditions and governing regulations of previously approved permits shall be enforced pursuant to chapter 80.
IV.
Outstanding violations
. Any violation of the previous county land use code will continue to be a violation under this code and be subject to penalties and enforcement under chapter 80, unless the use, development, construction, or other activity complies with the provisions of this code.
V.
Projects in process.
Except as expressly provided in this code, the provisions of this code shall not apply to the review and approval of any project which is in process on the effective date but where the decision-making body has not taken final action. A project is considered in process if the application has been deemed complete as of the effective date by the director in accordance with previous code section 82-92.
Applicants that have received conceptual development plan or preliminary subdivision plat approval prior to the effective date shall:
A.
Within one (1) year of the date of preliminary approval, submit a complete application for final approval of at least one phase of the project. The application for final plat approval shall comply with the code in effect at the time preliminary approval was granted;
B.
After approval of a final plat for only one (1) phase or portion of the property subject to the previously approved conceptual development plan or preliminary subdivision plat, submit a complete application for each subsequent phase of the project within one (1) year of the county’s approval of the previous final subdivision plat.
If an applicant fails to submit a complete application for final approval according to the time period specified herein, the preliminary approval shall be deemed void and all development on the real property shall be subject to this code.
VI.
Modifications to previously approved plats, plans, and permits
. Proposed modifications to any approved final plat, plan, or land use permit shall be in conformance with this code. An applicant may seek a variance under section 66-27 in the case of exceptional practical difficulties or undue hardship arising from the strict application of the provisions of this code to a specific property in a previously approved project.

Sec. 81-4 Interpretation
In the interpretation and application of this code, the following criteria shall govern:
I.
Burden of proof.
The burden of proof is upon the applicant to show full compliance with the purposes of these regulations.
II.
Minimum requirements.
The requirements of this code shall be regarded as the minimum requirements necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, general welfare and for the protection of the natural environment. This code shall therefore be regarded as remedial and shall be liberally construed to further its underlying purposes.
III.
Abrogation
. This code is not intended to abrogate or annul any valid subdivision plats, easements, covenants, building permits, legal established lots, or uses established, approved or issued before the effective date of this code.

Sec. 81-5 Construction
The following are rules regarding construction of language in this code:
I.
Conflicting provisions
.
A.
More versus less restrictive. Where there exists a conflict or overlap between any provisions within this code or between this code and any other regulation adopted by the county, the provision that is the more restrictive or particular shall prevail over that which is less restrictive or general.
B.
Text versus table, illustration, graphic depiction or caption. If a conflict or overlap arises between the provisions of the text of this code and any table, illustration, graphic depiction or the captions for any chapter, section or subsection, the provisions of the text shall prevail.
C.
Private agreements. It is not the intent of this code to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any easement, covenant, deed restriction, or other agreement between private parties. If the provisions of this code impose a greater restriction than imposed by a private agreement, the provisions of this code shall control. If the provisions of a private agreement impose a greater restriction than this code, the provisions of the private agreement shall control. The county shall not be responsible for monitoring or enforcing private agreements, such as private subdivision covenants and restrictions.
II.
Exercise of authority
. Whenever a provision appears requiring the director, or the head of any other county department to perform an act or duty, it shall be construed to authorize the director or the head of any other county department to designate, delegate and authorize subordinates to perform the duty or act. When this code delegates authority or discretion to the director or the head of any other county department, such authority or discretion shall be exercised in a reasonable manner and uniformly applied to all persons and things in order that property owners and other persons will be protected against arbitrary and capricious administrative action. The director shall exercise fair, honest and independent judgment in the director’s role as a decision-maker.
III.
Computation of time
. The time within which an act is to be done shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day; or if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday observed by the county, the next business day shall be the deadline. References to “days” are calendar days (versus business or workdays), unless otherwise stated.
A.
Day. The end of the day shall be at 5:00 P.M., local time.
B.
Week. The word “week” shall mean seven (7) days.
C.
Month. The word “month” shall mean thirty (30) days.
D.
Year. The word “year” shall mean three hundred and sixty-five (365) days.
IV.
Fractions.
Whenever a fraction is generated in the computation of standards, such as required parking spaces or the number of required trees or shrubs, the fraction shall be rounded to the next highest whole number.
V.
Word usage.
A.
Tense. Words used in present tense include the future, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary.
B.
Singular and plural. A word importing the singular number may extend and be applied to several persons and things as well as to one (1) person or thing. The use of the plural number shall include any single person or thing, unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary.
C.
Shall/must/may/should. The words “shall” and “must” mean mandatory, “may” means permissive and “should” means preferred.
D.
Masculine/Feminine. The masculine gender shall include the feminine and the feminine gender shall include the masculine.
E.
Conjunctions. Unless the context clearly suggests otherwise, conjunctions shall be interpreted as follows:
“And” means that all connected items, conditions, provisions or events apply; and
"Or" means that one or more of the connected items, conditions, provisions or events apply.
F.
Common/technical terms. Unless specifically defined by this code, words and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved meaning of the term, but technical words and phrases which have acquired a particular meaning shall be understood according to such meaning.
G.
Lists and examples. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, lists of items or examples that use terms such as "for example," "including," and "such as," or similar language are intended to provide examples, not to be exhaustive lists of all possibilities.
H.
References to statutes, regulations, publications and documents. Whenever reference is made to a resolution, ordinance, statute, regulation, or document, it shall be construed as a reference to the most recent edition of such regulation, resolution, ordinance, statute, regulation, or document, unless otherwise specifically stated.

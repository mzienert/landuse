Chapter 20 procurement code
ARTICLE I – INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 20-9 References to job titles and exercise of authority
Job title references throughout this
code
are provided for convenience only and are based upon titles as they exist on January 1, 2021. The roles and responsibilities set forth in this code correspond to the job function rather than job title and do not change when a job title changes. Every effort shall be made to ensure compliance with this code, regardless of job title, by substituting the new title or titles applicable to the job responsibilities at issue.
Whenever a provision appears requiring an elected official, department head, contract manager, contract procurement specialist or other county representative to perform an act of duty, it shall be construed to authorize that individual to designate, delegate or authorize subordinates to perform any duty or act, unless otherwise expressly prohibited by the BOCC in this code or in any policy.

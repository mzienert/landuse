Chapter 73 Standards and Additional Submittal Requirements for Specific Uses
Overview
The specific uses addressed in this chapter require particular attention for a variety of reasons. Although many uses have the potential to impact neighbors by generating noise, dust, odor, light, traffic or other potential nuisances, some uses require evaluation and mitigation efforts beyond those established more generally elsewhere in the code. By way of example, some uses present additional concerns to the health, safety and welfare of the community at large that justify special attention in this chapter. Other uses addressed in this chapter warrant special attention in order to accommodate unique technical considerations or to coordinate the county’s interests with regulations and standards set at the state and federal levels. Some uses addressed in this chapter present opportunities to promote the county’s interest in the use by allowing different standards than those generally applicable.
Sec. 73-8 Commercial outdoor shooting range
I.
Applicability.
These standards and submittal requirements apply to any land use permit application proposing a shooting range that is generally open to use by members of the public, whether operating for profit or not for profit, and not entirely enclosed within a building. Nothing in this section shall be construed as a designation under C.R.S. § 30-15-302(1) prohibiting the discharge of firearms in the unincorporated county, nor shall this section be construed to restrict or otherwise affect a person’s constitutional rights to bear arms and defend person, family or property.
II.
Standards specific to commercial outdoor shooting ranges.
A.
Setbacks. The following minimum setbacks shall apply to all facilities associated with a shooting range subject to this section:
1.
From the property lines of a lot or parcel containing an oil and gas development or an oil and gas facility: five hundred (500) feet;
2.
From the outermost limits of any portion of an oil and gas facility located on the proposed subject parcel: five hundred (500) feet;
3.
From the property lines of residential uses: five hundred (500) feet;
4.
From the property lines of nonresidential uses: five hundred (500) feet;
5.
From the legally described boundary line of a public rights-of-way: five hundred (500) feet;
6.
From the wellhead of a well supplying water for human consumption: five hundred (500) feet;
7.
From the outermost limits of any body of surface water or wetlands: five hundred (500) feet;
8.
From the outermost limits of a dry streambed: fifty (50) feet;
9.
From the outmost bank of irrigation canals and ditches: seventy (70) feet.
B.
A shooting position shall not be situated more than one thousand (1,000) feet from its intended target impact area.
C.
A shooting position shall not be situated in a way that the resulting line of fire to its intended target impact area is above horizontal. The director may waive this criterion upon a showing that the size and other topographical features of the subject parcel, including without limitation natural terrain features, sufficiently mitigate the risk of projectiles traveling beyond the property lines of the subject parcel.
D.
The perimeter of the shooting range or the parcel containing the shooting range shall be fenced and warning signs shall be posted at least every one hundred (100) feet along such fence line.
E.
Noise. Noise from the operation of the shooting range shall not exceed state noise standards set forth in section 70-21 and C.R.S. § 25-12-103.
F.
Hours of operation. Firing of weapons and other activities that will generate noise beyond the property lines of the subject parcel shall be conducted between the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., or as approved by the decision-making body.
G.
Wildlife impacts. Applicant shall conduct a wildlife assessment to identify any adverse impacts to wildlife. The applicant shall implement mitigation measures set forth in the applicant’s wildlife analysis to the maximum extent feasible.
III.
Submittal Requirements.
In addition to the general land use permit application submittal requirements set forth in section 66-11, applicant shall submit the following documents and materials:
A.
A site plan containing these additional requirements, whether existing or proposed:
1.
Topography of the parcel with contour lines of sufficient detail to portray the direction and rate of slope of the subject parcel;
2.
A vicinity map identifying all property owners and uses within one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet as measured from the property line of the parcel;
3.
Locations of all shooting positions, target impact areas, and bullet stops, including an explanation of any excavation or other dirt work necessary for the creation of the same;
4.
Location and proposed use of structures, including schematics of all structures proposed to be constructed associated with the shooting range;
5.
Dimensioning of all existing landscaping as well as landscaping proposed and required by this section and section 70-17.
B.
Operating plan. A plan for the method of operations, including without limitation:
1.
A statement of the number of permanent and temporary employees anticipated on site during operation of the shooting range;
2.
A statement of the number of patrons who may be on site during the operation of the shooting range;
3.
A statement addressing the applicant’s preparedness and protocol for responding to a wildfire beginning on or near the subject parcel as a result of the operation of the shooting range;
4.
Specifications of any explosive or concussion producing ordinance kept on the site, temporarily or permanently, that may be associated with the shooting range;
5.
Anticipated traffic distributions relative to the shooting range’s shooting positions, impact areas, and bullet stops;
6.
A statement addressing how the construction, layout, and operation of the shooting range is in general conformance with industry best practices for shooting ranges as supported by references to such standards (e.g., the National Rifle Association’s “The Range Source Book” or similar generally accepted standards);
7.
A statement of whether firing on the shooting range will ever be allowed more than thirty (30) minutes after sunset. If such firing will be allowed, specifications of the type and location of proposed lighting and an explanation of how such lighting will provide for the safety of range users and comply with section 70-7.
C.
A noise study that demonstrates the proposed shooting range (whether due to the natural size, shape or other topographical features of the subject parcel or due to mitigation such as use of landscaping) can meet the requirements of C.R.S. § 25-12-103 et seq., except as excluded for construction activities, based on measuring the sound levels of noise radiating from the property line at a distance of twenty-five (25) or more feet beyond the subject parcel.
D.
A description of wildlife occurrences on and within five hundred (500) feet of the perimeter of the parcel, including:
1.
Significant seasonal occurrences of species;
2.
Occurrences of threatened or endangered species, as listed by the USFWS, NMFS or by the CDNR;
3.
Assessment of the proposed construction’s and operation’s impacts on the identified species, particularly regarding:
a.
Potential displacement of wildlife;
b.
Disruption of wildlife corridors or wildlife habitat;
c.
The extent to which suitable wildlife habitat may be replaced upon cessation of all construction or shooting range operations and implementation of the plan for reclamation.
E.
A reclamation plan that, at a minimum, follows the general guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Best Management Practices for Lead at Outdoor Shootings Ranges, as amended, which includes but is not limited to the following:
1.
Mitigation of impacts to ground and surface water;
2.
Mitigation of soil erosion and surface runoff to limit lead migration off-site;
3.

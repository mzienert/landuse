DIVISION 3. WEED MANAGEMENT PLAN
Sec.  58-109 Other
109.1 Containment and Buffering Strategies
Management and Buffering Strategies: All landowners and land managers with county listed weed species will be required to implement the following management strategies:
Infestations of one acre or less:
Isolated small populations: Intensive best management practices applied with eradication goals in mind. Prevent seed formation and root spread on an annual basis.
Satellite populations proximate to larger populations: Intensive best management practices applied with eradication, containment, and reduction goals in mind. Prevent seed formation and root spread on an annual basis.
Larger populations of more than one acre:
Using effective, best management practices, apply containment and perimeter buffering management practices at a minimum of fifty feet wide each growing season. Prevent seed formation and root spread on an annual basis.
Continue weed management in the year-one fifty-foot buffer zone. Perimeter buffering management practices shall be stepped inward toward the center of the infestation at a minimum of fifty feet wide each season thereafter until the desired goals of the weed management plan have been met.
109.2 Treating in or around ditch areas
Colorado requires a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit through the Clean Water Act for applications in or near water. Use of products shall comply with State and Federal law and product labels.
The State of Colorado NPDES Advisory Committee has recommended a clarification in the definition of ditches. Ditches are now divided into wet ditches and dry ditches in Colorado.
Dry Ditch Treatments:
La Plata County Contractors will treat only dry ditches; therefore a NPDES Permit will not be required.
Wet Ditch Treatments:
If it is further determined that certain wet ditches need to be treated for target weeds, a special work order will be issued before any treatments occur. Exact wet treatment footage will be noted and submitted with the treatment data. Only EPA registered aquatic labeled products will be applied in wet ditches. Treatment thresholds of twenty (20) linear miles shall not be exceeded annually, therefore eliminating the requirement for a NPDES permit.

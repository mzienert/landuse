Sec. 90-14 Financial assurances
Every operator of an
OGL
or
OGF
that is subject to the requirements of this chapter 90 shall provide the county with financial assurance in the types and amounts, subject to adjustments for inflation, required to comply with this section 90-14. It is the operator’s responsibility to ensure that financial assurance approved by the county remains in place at all times unless or until it is released by the county pursuant to subsection 90-14.VII or substitute financial assurance is approved pursuant to subsection 90-14.VI. The purpose of the county’s financial assurance is to protect the public health, safety, welfare, environment and wildlife resources in the county by ensuring that operators are capable of performing all of their obligations under this code and any applicable permit or approval issued by the county, including without limitation, ongoing mitigation of adverse impacts, operational and reporting requirements and duty to reclaim the surface of the site of an OGL or OGF at no cost to the county or public consistent with the requirements of this code and any applicable permit or approval issued by the county.
I.
Existing oil and gas operations.
Every operator of an OGL or OGF that lawfully exists as of the effective date of this chapter 90, or that is timely vested pursuant to a permit or approval issued by the county prior to the effective date of this new chapter 90, shall submit a financial assurance plan as part of the first annual report required by section 90-16. The financial assurance plan shall demonstrate how the operator proposes to comply with the financial assurance requirements of this section 90-14 with respect to each of the operator’s OGLs and OGFs within the county that is subject to the county’s jurisdiction. For purposes of the initial application to existing OGLs and OGFs, this section 90-14 shall be read to require an existing OGL or OGF to satisfy the county’s financial assurance requirements to the same extent as if the county were presently reviewing and permitting such OGL or OGF.
The director may request additional information or clarification that the director deems necessary to evaluate the proposed financial assurance and establish the appropriate financial assurance amount consistent with this section 90-14. If the director requests additional information, the operator shall submit such additional information to the director within ten (10) days of such request, unless a longer period is authorized by the director in writing.  The director shall issue a written determination of the required financial assurance. An operator shall provide the county with the required financial assurance within ninety (90) days of the director’s written determination establishing the required financial assurance.
If the financial assurance plan reveals that an OGL or OGF does not have a county approved final reclamation plan and associated financial assurance, the operator shall submit with its first annual report, a reclamation plan that contains the information set forth in subparagraph 90-5.I.R.  As to the financial assurance related to reclamation of an OGL or OGF lacking a final reclamation plan only, one extension of time up to six (6) months may be approved by the director for the submittal of a reclamation plan and its associated financial assurance if all the following are satisfied:​​​​​​
A.
A written request for the extension is submitted as part of the operator’s first annual report.
B.
The operator provides a written explanation for why the extension is warranted considering all relevant circumstances including, but not limited to, the number of OGL or OGF operated by the operator that do not have final reclamation plans, the availability of personnel or consultants to develop the necessary reclamation plan and anticipated complexity of the reclamation plan.
All other extensions of time to complete the final reclamation plan and provide the associated financial assurance must be approved by the board.
II.
New oil and gas operations.
Every permit or approval issued by the county pursuant to this chapter 90 includes, whether expressly identified as a condition of approval, a condition that the applicable required financial assurance must be provided to the county before any work subject to county permit or approval is performed.
III.
Types and amounts of required financial assurances.
A.
The financial assurance required by the county is equal to the cumulative total of the following categories of financial assurance, subject to any offset approved by the decision-making body pursuant to paragraph III.B below:
1.
County permit and code compliance.  Every permit or approval issued by the county pursuant to this chapter 90 includes a condition that financial assurance be provided to the county to protect it and the public from the risk of expenses to the county in the event the operator does not comply with ongoing applicable standards and conditions required by the county’s code, permit or approval during the lifetime of the OGL, OGF or other oil and gas operations within the county. Every operator operating or who initiates production at an OGL or OGF within the county shall provide a county-wide blanket financial assurance to the county in an amount of at least one hundred seventy-five thousand (175,000) dollars.
2.
Construction phase and completion phase impacts.  Every permit or approval issued by the county that contemplates the use of county roads for heavy equipment to access the site during the construction phase or completion phase includes a condition that financial assurance be provided to the county in an amount of at least five thousand (5,000) dollars.  The county’s financial assurance for construction phase and completion phase impacts is intended to protect the county from the risk of damages to county roads, bridges, other infrastructure from the use of heavy equipment and violations of the county’s standards and conditions related to such construction phase and completion phase activities.  The portion of financial assurance attributable to construction phase and completion phase impacts is subject to release by the county pursuant to subsection 90-14.VII following satisfactory completion of all construction phases and completion phases of the approved OGL, OGF, or other permit or approval.
3.
Interim reclamation.  Every permit or approval issued by the county that requires interim reclamation includes a condition that financial assurance be provided to the county in an amount equal to at least one hundred fifteen (115) percent of the estimated costs of performing such interim reclamation as documented by the operator and approved by the decision-making body.  The county’s financial assurance for interim reclamation is intended to protect the county from the risk of expenses incurred by the county to perform the required interim reclamation work in a manner required by the county’s code, permit or approval as well as expenses resulting from any violations of the county’s standards and conditions related to such interim reclamation.  The portion of financial assurance attributable to interim reclamation is subject to release by the county pursuant to subsection 90-14.VII following satisfactory completion of such interim reclamation requirements. Interim reclamation shall not be judged successful and complete sooner than all of the following have occurred: two (2) years after compliance with the applicable final reclamation plan and standards; submission of a Form 4 interim reclamation completion notice to the
CDD
that satisfies all requirements of
ECMC
Rule 1003.e.(3); the director or
LGD
complete or waive an interim reclamation inspection to confirm the description and photographs submitted with the Form 4; and a self-sustaining, native (or otherwise approved) plant community is established at the OGL, with a density sufficient to control erosion and non-native plant invasion and to reestablish wildlife habitat or forage production.
4.
Final reclamation.  Every permit or approval issued by the county that requires final reclamation includes a condition that financial assurance be provided to the county in an amount equal to at least one hundred fifteen (115) percent of the estimated costs of performing such final reclamation as documented by the operator and approved by the decision-making body.
5.
Case-by-case adjustment.  The amounts above represent minimum requirements. The decision-making body may increase the minimum required financial assurance on a case-by-case basis to fulfill the purposes of the financial assurance and considering the operator’s history of compliance. Other relevant factors may include, without limitation, the characteristics of the roads, bridges, and infrastructure at risk; the scope and complexity of the work to be performed; the number, type, and weight of equipment used; the time of year the operations are conducted; and whether county staff could step in to perform the work or whether independent contractors would be required to perform the work on the county’s behalf if the operator failed to complete the work.
B.
Offsets for financial assurances provided to other agencies.  In instances in which an operator has provided financial assurance to another government agency to ensure compliance with respect to the same OGL or OGF for which a county financial assurance is required, a prorated amount of such other financial assurance attributable to the OGL or OGF subject to county financial assurance may be used to offset the county’s financial assurance requirements.  The decision-making body reviewing the adequacy of the financial assurance shall have discretion to determine whether the other financial assurance satisfies the requirements of this code and to what extent, if any, such other financial assurance may offset the amounts required by this code.
C.
Access to financial assurance.  The entire amount of financial assurance held by the county (or held by another person or governmental entity for which an offset was approved) at any time is available to the county to ensure that all operations are conducted in a manner consistent with the standards of this code, permit or approval. In addition, the entire amount of financial assurance held by the county (or any portion held by another person or governmental entity for which an offset was approved) at any time is available to satisfy any fee, fine, penalty, or other remedy owed to the county pursuant to this code, and the county may draw upon the financial assurance to satisfy the same.  If the county draws upon financial assurance for any reason, it is the operator’s obligation to ensure the full amount of financial assurance remains to fulfill any ongoing obligations of the operator to the county, including a requirement to immediately replenish or replace any financial assurance spent by the county.
IV.
Acceptable forms of financial assurances.
An operator shall satisfy its financial assurance obligations to the county by using a cash bond, surety bond, letter of credit or escrow account, unless the ECMC, following a hearing, has approved another form of acceptable financial assurance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the county reserves the right to make a final determination of the acceptable form of county financial assurance, and in no event shall the county accept self-bonding. All forms of financial assurance must expressly acknowledge that the county may draw upon and thereafter spend the financial assurance immediately after written notice to the holder or issuer of the financial assurance that the requirements of subsection IX below have been satisfied.
V.
Periodic review and call-up.
A.
Periodic review.  All financial assurances required by this section 90-14 are subject to periodic review by the director. The director may review the adequacy of existing financial assurance at any time, but the director shall not require an increase in an existing financial assurance more than one time per calendar year; provided, however, that this limitation does not apply to increases to financial assurance as a result of a code enforcement matter or review of an operator’s request (such as a request for approval of substitute financial assurance pursuant to subsection 90-14.VI).  The factors considered by the director in evaluating whether financial assurance remains adequate shall include, without limitation, changes to the scope of operations, changes in the operator’s financial fitness, the operator’s recent history of compliance or noncompliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and inflation.  In considering whether inflation warrants adjustment to an operator’s financial assurance, the director shall rely on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for the Denver Core Based Statistical Area as the primary metric but may rely on other sources, as appropriate, including guidance issued by the ECMC director relative to implementation of ECMC Rule 707.a.(1).  In years when the director determines that an inflation adjustment is necessary, the adjustment should be applied as equally as possible to all operators.
B.
Call-up.  The following decisions are subject to the call-up procedures set forth in subparagraph 90-4.II.E.3:
1.
An initial determination of required financial assurance by the director; and
2.
A change to an existing financial assurance required by the director because of a periodic review.
VI.
Substitution; process; timing.
A.
Submittals. An operator may request a substitution of existing financial assurance by submitting the following to the director:
1.
A narrative explaining the details of the date originally approved, amount, form, and conditions of the existing financial assurance; the proposed new amount, form, and conditions of financial assurance; and the reasons for the request.
2.
A copy of the existing financial assurance.
3.
A copy of any permit and conditions of approval secured by the financial assurance.
4.
A draft of the proposed new financial assurance.
5.
If the amount of financial assurance is based on a cost estimate (such as an estimate for interim reclamation costs or final reclamation costs) that is more than two (2) years old, an updated cost estimate.
6.
If the proposed new financial assurance is not a cash or surety bond, evidence that the ECMC has conducted a hearing and approved the new financial assurance form.
7.
If the operator’s last annual report submitted pursuant to section 90-16 was submitted more than three (3) months before the request to substitute financial assurance, an updated annual report that satisfies the requirements of section 90-16.
8.
A written certification that no event-based reports or notices required by section 90-17 are due to the county.
9.
A draft letter, form of release, or other necessary documentation required to release the existing financial assurance, including instructions on the delivery of the same.
B.
Review. The director shall review the proposed new financial assurance for compliance with all requirements of this section as if the director were conducting a periodic review to determine the adequacy of the financial assurance pursuant to subsection 90-14.V.
C.
Process; timing.  Within thirty (30) days of receiving all the submittals required by paragraph VI.A above, the director will notify the operator of a final decision with respect to the request or identify additional information needed to evaluate the request. The director shall not unreasonably withhold approval of the proposed new financial assurance so long as the proposed new financial assurance satisfies all standards imposed by this section 90-14 and the existing financial assurance remains in place until the new financial assurance becomes effective.
VII.
Conditions for release of financial assurance.
A.
Submittals. An operator may request release of financial assurance by submitting the following to the director:
1.
A narrative explanation of the details of the date originally approved, amount, form, and conditions of the existing financial assurance; what performance obligations or conditions it secures and a certification by the operator of the status of each such obligation or condition, including relevant dates and supporting evidence such as photographs and inspection reports demonstrating that particular work has been performed and meets applicable standards; and the reasons for the request.
2.
A copy of the existing financial assurance.
3.
A copy of any permit and conditions of approval secured by the financial assurance.
4.
If the operator’s last annual report submitted pursuant to section 90-16 was submitted more than three (3) months before the request to release financial assurance, an updated annual report that satisfies the requirements of section 90-16.
5.
A written certification that no event-based reports required by section 90-17 are due to the county.
6.
A draft letter, form of release, or other necessary documentation required to release the existing financial assurance, including instructions on the delivery of the same.
B.
Review; standards.  The county shall not release a financial assurance until all relevant performance obligations and conditions secured by the financial assurance have been satisfied, unless an adequate substitution of financial assurance is reviewed and approved pursuant to subsection 90-14.VI or the county permit is being surrendered before any work requiring reclamation has been performed.  As a condition of release, an operator shall relinquish the permit, approval, or portion thereof related to any financial assurance that is released by the county and such permit may no longer be relied upon by the operator to perform any work or other development activities for which a permit, approval, or financial assurance is required.
C.
Process; timing.  Within forty-five (45) days of receiving all the submittals required by paragraph VII.A above, the director will notify the operator of a final decision with respect to the request or identify additional information needed to evaluate the request. The director shall not unreasonably withhold or delay approval of the release of financial assurance so long as all obligations and conditions secured by the financial assurance have been satisfied.
VIII.
Cancellation of financial assurance.
All forms of financial assurance accepted by the county shall include a requirement that they cannot be cancelled or non-renewed without at least thirty (30) days advance written notice to the operator and the county, evidenced by receipt, except when such financial assurance is being cancelled for nonpayment by the operator in which case ten (10) days advance written notice is required.  Language relating to cancellation requirements stating that the issuer or holder is limited to “endeavor to” provide such notice is not acceptable. In addition, the terms of the financial assurance shall require the issuer or holder to provide written notice to the county within five (5) business days of disbursing all or a portion of the financial assurance to any party other than the county.
IX.
Forfeiture of financial assurance.
Upon finding by the board pursuant to this subsection that an operator is out of compliance with this code, or a permit or approval issued by the county, the board shall declare the operator in default. Such declaration shall be in the form of a motion at a meeting of which the applicant has been notified at least ten (10) days prior to such meeting.  After finding an applicant in default, the board shall take one (1) or more of the following actions:
A.
Access the financial assurance. The board may access the financial assurance to bring the operator or site into compliance, including satisfying any damages, penalties, fines, or other financial obligations owed to the county. If performance of work is required, the work may be completed using county resources or may be contracted out to a private firm.
B.
Temporary suspension or permanent revocation. The board may temporarily suspend or permanently revoke a county approval or permit.
C.
Assess fines. The board may directly assess fines or direct the director to assess fines pursuant to section 90-18.
D.
Use of proceeds. The board may contract with any person (including without limitation any subsequent operator who has acquired the oil and gas operation, OGF, or OGL by purchase, foreclosure or otherwise) who is willing to covenant to perform the work necessary to bring the subject oil and gas operation(s), OGF(s), or OGL(s) into compliance.  If the board enters such a contract to have work performed, the board may assign proceeds or its right to receive proceeds, if any, collected under a financial assurance to the contracting party for use of the proceeds to perform the work required to come into compliance. The agreement to assign proceeds, if any, shall only be made after the work plan has been reviewed and approved by the board and after additional adequate financial assurance, if any, has been provided by the contracting party in accordance with the standards of this code. If the contracting party is a subsequent operator of noncompliant oil and gas operation(s), OGL(s), or OGF(s) that require corrective work to come into compliance with this code, such subsequent operator’s obligation to complete work or otherwise come into compliance pursuant to an agreement under this section shall not be affected by the failure of the county to collect proceeds under the financial assurance if the county makes a
good faith
effort to obtain such proceeds.
E.
Pursue operator. The amount of the financial assurance is not a cap on the recovery to which the county is entitled. If the financial assurance is not sufficient to cover the costs of work, fines, damages, other expenses or other remedies available to the county, the county retains all other enforcement options available by law. The board may sue the operator for specific performance or recovery of any amount necessary to cure the default over and above the amount available under the financial assurance.
F.
Pursue any other remedy available by law. The board may authorize the county attorney’s office to review and pursue any other remedy available by law.

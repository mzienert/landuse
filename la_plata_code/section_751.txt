Arbitration is a proceeding by which parties to a controversy or dispute voluntarily submit the controversy to a neutral third
person
of their own choice as a substitute for the ordinary processes of the law in order to obtain a more speedy and inexpensive final disposition. Arbitration gives taxpayers an alternative to pursuing an appeal of the
county
board
of equalization's decision through either the board of assessment appeals or the district court.

ARTICLE II. DIRECTIONAL SIGNS AND BUSINESS PLAQUES
Sec. 98-10. Renewals.
Applications for renewal of
directional sign
and
business plaque
permits
shall
be made by the
applicant
and received by the
administrator
on or before April 1 of each year, and shall be accompanied by the annual fee. The
county
may
deny an application for a renewal if, in the sole discretion of the administrator, the permitting and placement of a directional sign at a certain location would endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public or would be inconsistent with the standard engineering practices, or the administrator finds that there is an existing
violation
of the eligibility requirements of this article. If a renewal application is denied, the administrator shall provide the applicant with written notice of the denial, which explains the basis, and shall return the annual fee that was submitted with the renewal application. If a permit renewal is not received or denied, the business plaque shall be removed.

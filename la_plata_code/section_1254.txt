DIVISION 3. FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
Sec. 78-76. Floodways.
Located within areas of special
flood
hazard are areas designated as "floodways." Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
All encroachments within floodways including fill,
new construction
,
substantial improvements
and other
development
are prohibited, unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a licensed Colorado
Professional Engineer
and in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase (requires a
no-rise certification
) in flood levels within the
community
during the occurrence of the
base flood
discharge.
If the general standards of section 78-72 are satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

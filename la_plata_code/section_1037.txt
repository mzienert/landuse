Appendix A
Overview
In Colorado, the majority of land use responsibility and decisions reside at the local level of government (county and municipal). Various laws give counties authority to plan for and regulate the use of land. La Plata County has previously developed and adopted regulations that address, among other things, the use of land based on the impact the use has on the surrounding area, the subdivision of land for residential, commercial and
industrial
purposes, ensuring an adequate water supply for new
development
, the establishment of roads and activities in hazardous areas. Regulations on these matters are primarily set forth in
chapter
65
(Animas Valley zon
e districts
and economic development areas), chapter
66
(permits and procedures), chapter
67
(division of land), chapter
68
(planned unit developments), chapter
70
(general site development standards
applicable to all development
), chapter
72
(overlay standards
and supplemental overlay standards
), chapter
73
(standards
and additional submittal requirements
for specific uses), chapter
74
(road and bridge standards and permits), and chapter
78
(floodplains), of the La Plata County Code.
The activities regulated by this Chapter 69 differ from those addressed elsewhere in the
county
’s land use code. These Chapter 69 regulations pertain solely to the types of activities described in Sec.
69-4
and derive from the Colorado General Assembly’s passage of the Areas and Activities of State Interest Act (C.R.S. §§ 24-65.1-101 through 24-65.1-502) in 1974 (commonly referred to as “1041 Powers” after the bill number of the state statute). These regulations authorize the county to have input on and to require a
permit
for certain activities that may have impacts beyond the immediate site of the
project
. These activities are therefore known as “
matters of state interest
”. Because the Colorado General Assembly has determined these specific activities are a matter of state concern, they are subject to a different type of land use review as described in this chapter. Generally, the regulations will apply to “large scale” rather than “small scale” projects.
Some of these activities could have substantial
impacts
on the citizens of the county while conferring little to no benefit to the local community but, rather, benefiting only residents in other counties or other states. In other instances, economic and other positive impacts may outweigh the negative impacts and these regulations allow the county to balance the impacts. These regulations provide for more local control over these types of activities and major projects.
These regulations will allow the county to better coordinate its interrelationship with other local governments, the State of Colorado and the federal government. Under state and federal law, many of these activities undertaken by these other governmental entities are not subject to the same county land use regulations that are applicable to private development. Without 1041 regulations, these governmental entities apply to a county for location and extent review (L&E) of a proposed activity. This L&E review procedure only provides the county with a limited opportunity to review, comment and approve or disapprove the project and only in relation to a county’s
comprehensive plan
. However, the other governmental entity can override county disapproval of the project and disregard its comments and concerns. This type of courtesy review does not give the county a voice as to these activities and is often inadequate to address complex projects with
significant
impacts. These 1041 regulations create a tool to ensure projects by other governments that impact unincorporated La Plata County serve the community’s goals and protect the public interest and welfare of La Plata County citizens.
To prevent duplication where the procedures in this chapter may overlap with the county's requirements for other types of land use permits, the provisions of these regulations control and the
director
may waive or modify applicable requirements under other chapters.

sec. 69-8 levels of permit review and changes in level of review
There are three (3) pos
sible levels of permit review under this chapter: a
FONSI
, an administrative
permit
review and a major permit review. The
director
shall make the initial determination of the appropriate level of permit review based upon the pre-submittal meeting and the
applicant
’s submittals.
The director’s determination may be appealed as provided in subsection 69-8.VI.
I.
FONSI. The director may determine that no
significant
impacts
are likely to occur from the
project
and therefore a permit under this chapter is not required. The director may make a FONSI if either of the following are satisfied:
A.
The construction or operation of the project, without additional
mitigation
or through the mitigation requirements of another applicable land use review or permit process, in its proposed location is unlikely to have any significant
adverse
impact to the
county
in consideration of all the approval criteria in these regulations; or
B.
The project was reviewed and approved by the county in conjunction with a land use approved prior to October 1, 2019 and the following requirements have been satisfied:
1.
The proposed project is located entirely within the boundaries of such
development
application;
2.
The approval criteria in this chapter have been satisfied in the course of the development application approval process; and
3.
No additional mitigation is necessary.
If the director makes a FONSI, the applicant does not need to submit a permit application under this chapter unless the
board
deems that a permit is necessary, following an appeal of the director's FONSI determination. If the director determines a FONSI is not appropriate based upon review of the pre-submittal materials and the information obtained at the pre-submittal meeting, the applicant must obtain a permit.
II.
Administrative permit review. The director shall determine an administrative permit review is required unless the director has made a FONSI determination or determines pursuant to subsection III below that the project warrants a major permit review.
III.
Major permit review. If the director determines a FONSI is not appropriate, the director shall determine whether the project should be subject to the administrative or major permit review provisions of this chapter. The director shall determine that a major permit review is required if:
A.
The project is likely to have a significant adverse impact in two (2) or more categories of criteria as described in the approval criteria section of this chapter; or
B.
The project is likely to have severe adverse impacts in any one (1) category of criteria as described in the approval criteria section of this chapter.
IV.
Change in level of permit review. At any time prior to the final decision on an application, the director may determine that information received subsequent to the level of permit determination indicates that the nature and scope of the impacts of the project are such that a different level of permit review is required. If a different level of permit review is required, the director shall notify the applicant in writing within seven (7) days of the director’s determination of the necessity for the change.
V.
Director determination. The director shall determine, in writing the applicable level of permit review. The director shall make this determination within ten (10) business days after the pre-submittal meeting in which the applicant provides adequate information for the director to make such a determination. A notice of the determination of level of permit review shall be published in the legal notice section of a newspaper of general circulation within seven (7) days of the determination. The notice shall describe the project and the procedure for appealing the determination as provided in subsection VI below.
VI.
Appeals to the board.
Any
affected party
may appeal to the board the determination made by the director under subsection 69-8.V above.
Such appeal
shall be in writing, shall stat
e with specificity their interest in the matter, relationship to the project
and applicant
and the grounds for the appeal, and shall be filed with the director within ten (10) days of th
e director’s publication of the determination. Upon the timely filing of such appeal, the board shall review the director’s determination within fourteen (14) days. The board may amend the director’s determination based on the materials submitted in connection with the appeal, the information and/or materials relied on by the director, and the same applicable provisions from this chapter.

Chapter 74: Road and Bridge Standards and Permits
Sec. 74-2 Road classification standards and level of service standards
I.
Road classifications and standards for all private roads, public roads that are not county roads, county roads maintained by others, and new county roads.
All roads that are existing, new private roads, public roads that are not county roads, county roads maintained by others or new county roads relied upon for access to their development shall meet the minimum standards in 74-1.IV, Table 74-2 below and section 74-4. The classifications and standards in this section account for current ADT in addition to the ADT expected to be generated by the development or use. If the classifications and standards in Table 74-2 are not met, the development shall make the improvements necessary to meet the standard or wait until the needed improvements are constructed by others. In addition to the classifications and standards in Table 74-2, the public works director may require additional improvements based on specific safety concerns including, but not limited to, road alignment, site distance and vehicle type generated by development. The road classifications and corresponding standards are:

II.
Level of service standards for existing county roads.
A.
Level of service standards apply to any existing county road that experiences an increase in traffic due to a development, from the project entrance to the nearest state highway, city or town road. If the LOS is not met, the development shall make the improvements necessary to meet the LOS standard or wait until the needed improvements are constructed by others.
B.
Exemptions for level of service standards. The following projects are exempt from LOS standards:
1.
Development regulated by chapter 90.
2.
Subdivisions in which all lots are greater than thirty-five (35) acres.
C.
In addition to the level of service standards, the public works director may require additional improvements to county roads based on specific safety concerns including, but not limited to, road alignment, site distance and vehicle type generated by development.
D.
Paved county roads. The county has established specified levels of service for all paved county roads. The established level of service ensures that the operating conditions a driver experiences while traveling on a paved county road are maintained within the acceptable ranges established by the board. The capacity of a paved county road is defined as the maximum traffic volume that can be accommodated at the adopted level of service and depends on road characteristics, such as number of lanes, lane widths, intersection geometry and signalization, as determined by the Transportation Research Board, Highway Capacity Manual. Except as noted in paragraph 74-2.II.B., all paved county roads that experience an increase in traffic due to a proposed development must:
1.
Function at LOS D in the joint planning area, or future growth boundaries of a town or city;
2.
Function at LOS C in all other areas;
3.
Have a minimum of a twenty (20) foot width.
E.
Exemptions for portions of paved county roads. The following roads are exempt from level of service standards:
1.
County Road 240 (Florida Road) from Whippoorwill Drive to County Road 250 (East Animas);
2.
County Road 251, also known as 32nd Street, from Holly Ave. to County Road 250 (East Animas);
3.
County Road 250 (East Animas) between County Road 251 and County Road 240;
4.
Other urbanized county roads, as determined by the public works director or planning engineer, that no longer meet the criteria for uninterrupted flow shall be evaluated for level of service as interrupted flow.
F.
Unpaved county roads. The established level of service for unpaved roads ensures the road can accommodate emergency vehicles and not negatively impact maintenance or air quality. All unpaved county roads that experience an increase in traffic due to a proposed development must:
1.
Have a total surface width of twenty (20) feet.
2.
Carry no more than four hundred (400) ADT after completion of the project. Asphalt paving or double pin chip seal, if structurally adequate, with adequate sub-base and base course material, is required when cumulative traffic volumes exceed these capacities for unpaved roads. Double pin chip seal may be allowed only to improve a road that, with the new development, meets the thresholds of a major local road with less than nine hundred ninety-nine (999) ADT.
3.
Be adequately surfaced with all-weather material to carry the weight of a sixty thousand (60,000) pound vehicle, minimum front single axle = 24,000 pounds; minimum rear single axle = 32,000 pounds.

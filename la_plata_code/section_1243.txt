Sec. 78-51. Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator.
The duties and responsibilities of the
floodplain administrator
shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:
Review, approve, or deny all applications for
floodplain development permits
required by adoption of this chapter.
Review floodplain development permit applications to determine whether a proposed
building
site
, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding.
Review
permits
for proposed
development
to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control
Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required.
Inspect all development at appropriate times during the period of
construction
to ensure compliance with all provisions of this chapter, including proper elevation of the
structure
.
Interpretation of
floodplain
boundaries.
Where interpretation is needed as to the accurate location of the boundaries the
special flood hazard area
(for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretations.
If available, the
base flood elevation
as shown on the profiles and tabulations for the points in question shall be the governing factor in determining accurate boundaries and shall take precedence over the boundaries shown on the maps.
When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with subsection (V)(B) of this section, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, as criteria for requiring that
new construction
,
substantial improvements
or other development are administered in accordance with division 3 of this chapter.
Any
person
contesting the location of a floodplain boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the floodplain designation. Any boundary appeal must be substantiated by technical engineering data of sufficient detail to allow a determination to be made. The planning and building
departments
shall review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, both departments shall ensure that the encroachment provisions of division 3 of this chapter are met.
Information to be obtained and maintained. The floodplain administrator shall:
Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.
Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to
mean sea level
) of the
lowest floor
(including the
basement
) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement.
For all new or substantially improved
flood
proofed structures:
Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level to which the structure has been flood proofed); and
Maintain the
flood proofing
certifications required in this chapter.
Notification. Notify adjacent
communities
and the state water conservation
board
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to
FEMA
.
Maintenance. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

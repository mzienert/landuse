Chapter 73 Standards and Additional Submittal Requirements for Specific Uses
Overview
The specific uses addressed in this chapter require particular attention for a variety of reasons. Although many uses have the potential to impact neighbors by generating noise, dust, odor, light, traffic or other potential nuisances, some uses require evaluation and mitigation efforts beyond those established more generally elsewhere in the code. By way of example, some uses present additional concerns to the health, safety and welfare of the community at large that justify special attention in this chapter. Other uses addressed in this chapter warrant special attention in order to accommodate unique technical considerations or to coordinate the county’s interests with regulations and standards set at the state and federal levels. Some uses addressed in this chapter present opportunities to promote the county’s interest in the use by allowing different standards than those generally applicable.
Sec. 73-21 Telecommunication facilities
I.
Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to regulate the deployment of telecommunications facilities in a manner that safeguards the public health, safety, and welfare, to promote public access to sufficient and competitive personal wireless services in the unincorporated county, while mitigating any potential adverse effects of such deployment.
II.
Applicability.
Any deployment of a telecommunications facility shall require a land use permit, except for the following:
A.
Repairs that will not alter the physical appearance of a telecommunications facility;
B.
Removal of a telecommunications facility;
C.
Removal of antenna facilities from a telecommunications facility;
D.
Deployment which does not amount to a substantial change, upon confirmation by director determination.
E.
Deployment of one of the following:
1.
Amateur radio operators’ equipment licensed by the Federal Communications Commission;
2.
Any satellite earth station antenna two (2) meters (i.e. six feet and six and three quarter inches) or less in diameter which is located in an area whose existing or intended use is commercial or industrial;
3.
Any non-commercial satellite earth station antenna one (1) meter (i.e. three feet and three and three eighths inches) or less in diameter;
4.
Telecommunications towers with a tower height of less than thirty-five (35) feet, located on a gas or oil well pad, supporting only antennae that are solely used to transmit or receive information related to gas or oil well production;
5.
Utility meters that enable communication between the meter and the central utility system; and
6.
Small wireless facilities that are mounted upon or completely contained within a residence or commercial structure and have the sole purpose of improving telecommunications service for occupants of said residence or commercial structure.
III.
Deployment that does not amount to a substantial change.
Deployment of telecommunications facilities may be authorized without a land use permit upon a director determination that the deployment does not amount to a substantial change.
A.
Submittal requirements. To confirm that the deployment does not amount to a substantial change, the provider requesting the director determination shall submit:
1.
A narrative setting forth the deployment’s proposed location, purpose, and specifications;
2.
Documentation that the provider lawfully may occupy and develop the proposed facility in the proposed location;
3.
Scaled plan and elevation drawings of at least two (2) sides of the proposed facility or facilities;
4.
A professional engineer’s certification that the proposed facility is structurally sound;
5.
A written statement that the proposed deployment shall comply with the FCC’s limitations on human exposure to radiofrequency radiation;
6.
A written statement from the provider acknowledging that, because the provider’s request for a director determination is not an application for a land use permit, the provisions of 47 C.F.R. § 1.6003 shall not apply.
B.
Limitation on tower height. No proposed increase to an existing telecommunications tower’s height shall result in a tower’s height exceeding the restrictions set forth in subsection IV.
C.
Time for review. Following submittal of all required items, the director shall issue a determination, within sixty (60) days, confirming the proposed deployment does not amount to a substantial change, and thus does not require a land use permit, or advising that the provider must apply for a land use permit.
IV.
Standards specific to telecommunication facilities.
A.
Radiofrequency radiation. All facilities shall demonstrate compliance with FCC standards regarding radiofrequency radiation.
B.
No facility shall be larger than necessary to efficiently provide personal wireless service, and space for collocation as required by paragraph IV.C.
C.
New telecommunications towers or other structures intended to support an antenna facility shall be capable of supporting at least two (2) additional antenna facilities.
D.
Collocation of new telecommunications facilities shall be required, unless the provider provides evidence that there are no existing structures capable of supporting the antenna facilities required to provide the proposed personal wireless service, or evidence of the provider’s good faith, but unsuccessful, efforts to collocate on existing structures.
E.
Structure mounted facilities shall be designed and constructed to blend with the architectural characteristics of the structures on which they are proposed to be mounted.
F.
Antenna facilities associated with structure mounted facilities shall be either inside the structure, inside an existing cabinet, or in a new cabinet adjacent to and similar in material and color to existing cabinets and the structure itself.
G.
Speculative towers shall not be permitted.
H.
Lattice towers shall not be permitted unless the provider demonstrates, in writing, that:
1.
Any other structure will not meet the standards of this section;
2.
Aesthetic considerations favor the construction of a lattice tower at the proposed location;
3.
A monopole tower would not be technically feasible for the proposed deployment (as documented in writing by a professional engineer).
I.
No telecommunications tower shall exceed one hundred ninety-nine (199) feet in height.
J.
The setback from a telecommunications tower to any property line shall be at least 1.3 times the tower’s height.
K.
Antenna equipment associated with telecommunications towers shall meet the following requirements:
1.
Antenna equipment at ground level shall be in an enclosed structure that is architecturally compatible with the surrounding environment, or screened completely by vegetation, berms, landscaping boulders, or an architecturally compatible wall or fence.
2.
Security fencing shall enclose the minimum space necessary for safety and shall be designed to blend with the character of the existing environment.
3.
Antenna equipment shall be grouped as closely as possible to other antenna equipment and the tower.
4.
Antenna equipment at ground level shall not exceed a surface area of four hundred fifty (450) square feet per provider.
L.
Architectural integration with existing buildings, structures and landscaping, including height, color, style, massing, placement, design and shape is required. Concealment or stealth methods, such as camouflaging transmission towers to look like poles or trees may be required.
M.
Roof-mounted antennas shall be located as far away as feasible from the edge of the building. Antennas attached to a building should be painted or otherwise treated to match the exterior building.

A.
Abandonment prohibited. Telecommunications facilities shall not be disused unless they are also removed pursuant to this subsection.
B.
Abandonment determination. The director may request the board hold a hearing on the abandonment of a telecommunications facility. Notice of the hearing shall be provided to all providers holding permits to operate the facility, and the owner(s) of the parcel containing the facility, by certified mail at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. The board shall declare a telecommunications facility abandoned, and require its removal, if:
1.
The facility is unused by any provider for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days or more; or
2.
The facility presents an imminent danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the public.
C.
Removal. Upon a determination by the board that the telecommunications facility is abandoned, the permitted provider(s) shall have ninety (90) days to either resume use of the facility or remove it. Removal shall proceed according to the applicable provisions of the county building code and under the supervision of the building division.
D.
Reclamation.

Chapter 79 Nonconformities
Sec. 79-1 Purpose and applicability
I.
Purpose
. Within the county there are existing uses of real property, structures, lots, facilities and signs that were legally established or created but do not comply with the current requirements of this code. These are referred to as nonconformities. The purpose of this chapter is to establish provisions that recognize the interests of owners in continuing to use and maintain their property but that also reasonably limit expansion of nonconformities, re-establishment of nonconformities that have been discontinued or destroyed, and relocation and change of use of nonconformities. This chapter also addresses the unique circumstances where uses and structures may be destroyed as a result of a disaster.
II.
Applicability
.
A.
This chapter applies to nonconformities throughout unincorporated areas of the county. This chapter shall not apply to any nonconformities related to oil and gas locations or oil and gas facilities except as described in section 90-19.
B.
Illegally established lots, developments, structures, facilities, signs or uses of real property in unincorporated areas of the county are addressed through other parts of this code such as chapter 80, relating to enforcement and penalties.

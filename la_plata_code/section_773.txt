create and maintain a separate account within the County budget designated as the "Joint Sales Tax Fund Account."

4. If the amounts credited to the joint sales tax fund are in excess of the amounts necessary to fund previously and mutually approved jointly funded projects, such excess shall be carried as a fund balance in the Joint Sales Tax Fund Account unless the parties mutually agree that such excess be divided into equal shares and distributed at the close of the fiscal year to the City and County, respectively. The fund balance shall never exceed a maximum amount of $250,000.00 at the end of the fiscal year. Any interest earned on the fund balance shall be credited to the Joint Sales Tax Fund Account.

9. Upon this Agreement becoming effective it shall be binding upon the respective parties hereto and shall remain in full force and effect as long as the County collects or receives sales tax revenues from the one percent (1%) sales tax imposed pursuant to the special election of May 11, 1982, it being the intent and understanding of the parties that the amount to be credited annually to the joint sales tax fund shall be the equivalent of twenty-two percent (22%) of the revenue generated by the one percent (1%) sales tax imposed as a result of said special election of May 11, 1982.

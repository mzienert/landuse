The Loss Control & Safety Committee (Committee) represents equal ownership between departments regarding county safety, loss control, and health. The committee reflects the unity of effort that is coordinated and integrated among all county employees. The committee is meant to enhance county safety practices, policies, and procedures, while also mitigating safety risks. The committee assists in protecting county assets (personnel, equipment, property, data, intellectual assets, etc.) and mitigating losses where possible. The committee is supported by the safety-first commitment of supervisors, department heads, and elected officials.

Sec. 2-97. Committee Membership
Committee membership is composed of employees from departments and divisions designated by the risk manager to represent the different classes and working conditions in the county employee base. Committee members are selected for their interest and expertise regarding departmental safety standards and are appointed by their elected official or department head. Committee members are deemed safety coordinators for their respective department and will serve as the point of contact for safety-related matters for their department. If a safety coordinator is not available to fulfill his/her duties or elects to withdraw membership from the committee, the safety coordinator’s department head or elected official, in collaboration with the risk manager, is responsible for designating a backup, interim, or replacement safety coordinator.
All committee members and guests are required to review and sign a committee confidentiality agreement before attending their first committee meeting.

Accident Review Committee
1.
The Accident Review Committee can review, as needed, all accidents and incidents involving injury to county employees; injury to third parties while utilizing county property; damage to county property, damage to third-party property or equipment due to an accident or incident involving a county employee, property, or equipment; and/or motor vehicle accidents involving county-owned vehicles or personal vehicles operated by county employees while conducting official county business.
2.
The employees involved in the accident, if any, may be given notice of the time and place of the review, and may be entitled to attend, give testimony, and present such witnesses or evidence as they so desire. Testimony is not sworn. However, the Accident Review Committee may record the proceedings, at which time all parties present will be so advised. Failure of a county employee involved in an accident to attend, after receiving notice of such accident review, shall not be cause for the Accident Review Committee to discontinue its review.
3.
The Accident Review Committee makes a recommendation for corrective action, when applicable, to the appropriate Elected Official or Department Head after it concludes the review and findings. The County Manager receives a copy of the recommendation. The Accident Review Committee does not have the authority to impose employment disciplinary action on its own accord.
4.
Within 15 business days after the receipt of a recommendation, the Elected Official or Department Head must respond to and agree or disagree with the recommendation, citing the reason(s) why, and specifying any subsequent action(s) taken, if any.
5.
If, upon review of the accident, the Committee concludes that future accidents can be prevented through the change of policies or procedures, it will so advise the County Manager.
B.
Event Safety Committee

Sec. 2-101. Corrective or Disciplinary Action
If warranted, the appropriate Department Head, Elected Official, or designee shall take appropriate action under the County corrective or disciplinary action practices to prevent the recurrence of an accident or safety violation, as identified by the Committee. All recommendations of the Committee, other than a recommendation for dismissal of the employee involved, are intended to be corrective in nature to reduce the county’s liability for accidents, damage to county property, and/or employee injuries and illnesses. There should be a reasonable relationship between the offense that occurred and the recommendation. The Committee may recommend that a disciplinary action include requiring the at-fault employee to reimburse the county’s financial losses suffered, within reason and in accordance with labor laws. Any disciplinary action recommended will be done so in accordance with the terms of county personnel policies and procedures.

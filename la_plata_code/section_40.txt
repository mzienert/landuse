DIVISION 2. LOSS CONTROL AND SAFETY COMMITTEE
Sec. 2-97. Committee Membership
Committee membership is composed of employees from departments and divisions designated by the risk manager to represent the different classes and working conditions in the county employee base. Committee members are selected for their interest and expertise regarding departmental safety standards and are appointed by their elected official or department head. Committee members are deemed safety coordinators for their respective department and will serve as the point of contact for safety-related matters for their department. If a safety coordinator is not available to fulfill his/her duties or elects to withdraw membership from the committee, the safety coordinator’s department head or elected official, in collaboration with the risk manager, is responsible for designating a backup, interim, or replacement safety coordinator.
All committee members and guests are required to review and sign a committee confidentiality agreement before attending their first committee meeting.

Chapter 70: General Site Development Standards Applicable to All Development
Sec. 70-4 Domestic water
I.
Purpose, authority, and applicability
.
A.
Purpose. Securing a reliable and safe water source for all
development
, while
mitigating
any impacts of new
development’s
water consumption on existing uses’ water supply, is necessary to protect the community’s health, safety, and welfare, and the continued viability of
residential
,
commercial
, and
industrial
development. These water quantity and quality standards, therefore, are intended to secure the continued availability of adequate,
potable water
to
development
within the county’s
unincorporated
territories.
B.
Authority. Article 20 of Title 29 and Title 30 of the Colorado Revised Statutes authorize the Board of County Commissioners to regulate the use of land in a manner that protects against adverse impacts on the community, surrounding areas, and the natural environment, consistent with constitutional rights. This authorization includes a delegation of authority to consider the impacts of development on the quantity and quality of the region’s water resources. These water quantity and quality standards are intended to protect the community’s water resources and their availability for existing and future uses and to operate parallel to and consistent with those regulations promulgated, and permits issued, by the Division of Water Resources pursuant to Title 37 of the Colorado Revised Statutes and Title 402 of the Colorado Code of Regulations.
C.
Applicability. These provisions apply to all development except for:
1.
Development not requiring a land use permit;
2.
Adjustments and plat modifications approved pursuant to section 66-5 which do not require a change to existing water supply or demand;
3.
Lot consolidations and boundary adjustments approved pursuant to section 66-5, which do not require a change to existing water supply or demand;
4.
Special events approved pursuant to section 66-5;
5.
Temporary uses approved pursuant to section 66-6;
6.
Conceptual development plans and sketch plans submitted pursuant to section 66-6.
D.
Nothing in this section 70-4 shall be construed to exempt any development from complying with the requirement for adequate fire flow set forth in chapter 34 of the county code, Fire Prevention and Protection, as the same may be amended, replaced or modified. Fulfillment of the requirements set forth in chapter 34 may be a condition of approval for all development projects.
II.
Water demand estimate and criteria
. At the time of project submittal, all development subject to these water quantity and quality standards must provide the county with a representative estimate of the development’s peak daily water demand during a period of sustained water usage, according to either the stated requirements set forth in this subsection II or based upon completion of a site-specific water demand study. Required fire flows, if any, are not part of the water demand estimates required under this subsection II.
Any proposed development that establishes to the director's satisfaction that the proposed project has no water demand is not required to comply with the remaining portions of this section 70-4.
A.
Peak daily water demand required. Estimated water demand based upon the proposed development’s peak daily water demand shall be provided.
B.
Demand associated with water treatment. If a given water source requires water quality treatment, the peak daily water demand shall be increased to account for the water consumed by the anticipated treatment process. The applicant shall provide a specification sheet for the treatment unit or a statement from the engineer designing the treatment system (e.g. chlorinated cistern) that estimates the water efficiency of the treatment process.
C.
Residential uses.
1.
General demand. Except as otherwise provided herein, water demand for all residential projects shall be estimated to be three hundred fifty (350) gpd per dwelling unit, which accounts for both in-house demand (e.g., drinking, cooking, bathing, and washing) and outdoor demand during peak season (e.g., landscaping and irrigation).
2.
Multifamily dwelling demand. Residential uses that are multifamily dwellings with an anticipated irrigated area (e.g., lawn or garden) of one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet or less per dwelling unit (including each dwelling unit’s individual private irrigated area and its pro rata share of any irrigable common areas or open space) shall be subject to the following calculations:
a.
The minimum daily quantity requirement for
landscaping
or irrigation demand is 0.105 gallons per square foot per day.
b.
The general
residential
demand estimate of three hundred fifty (350) gpd may be reduced by 0.105 gallons per square foot, for each square foot of irrigated area less than one thousand five hundred
(1,500), as illustrated below.
a.
Figure 70-4: Residential Demand Estimate
b.
20’ x 40’ = 800f2 irrigable lawn
c.
1,500 f2 - 800 f2 = 700 f2
d.
700 f2 x .105 = 74 gpd
e.
350 gpd -74 gpd = 276 gpd residential demand estimate
c.
In no instance shall the minimum indoor demand be less than one hundred ninety-five (195) gpd.
d.
As an alternative to the calculation set forth above in sub-subparagraphs II.C.2.a-b, an applicant proposing development of a multifamily dwelling may conduct a site-specific water demand study pursuant to paragraph II.E below.
D.
Nonresidential water demand.
1.
Calculation based on Table 70-4 A. Nonresidential water demand, including but not limited to those for all commercial and industrial uses, shall be calculated based on the proposed use, according to the rates set forth in Table 70-4 A. Table 70-4 A’s rates are cumulative. Uses implicating two (2) or more of the listed demands must include all demands to derive the total required demand.
2.
Alternative methods for calculation. For any proposed use not listed below, and for which a site-specific water demand study is not specifically required, during the pre-application process prior to project submittal, the applicant may choose to prepare a site-specific water demand study pursuant to paragraph II.E. below, or subject to paragraph II.E., the applicant may request that the director determine, in writing, the applicable rates by equating or approximating a proposed use’s demand based on commonality with one (1) or more uses listed below. If the director determines that the proposed use is not sufficiently comparable to a use listed in Table 70-4 A for the purpose of estimating the proposed use’s water demand, the director may require the applicant to complete a site-specific water demand study.

3.
Site-specific water demand study.
e.
Alternative to standard requirements. As an alternative to the standard water demand rates set forth in paragraph II.D. above, a site specific water demand study may be prepared by the applicant to quantify the amount of water that will reasonably be required to serve the proposed development. Applicants may seek review and comment of the study from the planning engineer during the pre-application process prior to project submittal.
f.
Site-specific water demand study required for certain development. At the director’s discretion, a site-specific water demand study may be required for any proposed development not identified in Table 70-4 A. Applications proposing the following types of development shall prepare a site-specific water demand study and may not request a director determination letter based on commonality with existing estimates:
a.
Mineral extraction;
b.
Landfills and recycling centers;
c.
Batch Plants;
d.
Any use regulated by the county pursuant to C.R.S. §§ 24-65.1-101
et seq
., Areas and Activities of State Interest;
e.
Breweries, distilleries, cideries, and wineries.
g.
A site-specific water demand study shall fulfill the following minimum requirements:
a.
Preparation and stamp by a professional engineer or preparation by a certified professional geologist or professional hydrologist.
b.
Contents. A site-specific water demand study with the following information:
i.
The water source;
ii.
The number of square feet of land surface to be irrigated (if any);
iii.
Plant types and amounts (if any);
iv.
Estimates of plant/crop evapotranspiration and application efficiency of irrigation water;
v.
Itemized estimates of the water demands of any other activities, individual fixtures, or equipment associated with the proposed
development;
vi.
Itemized quantification of projected water demand.
c.
It is the county’s policy to encourage all development to establish water conservation measures. Preparation of a conservation plan, including specific measures to reduce water demand, is encouraged for all site-specific water demand studies.
F.
Criteria for verification of legal water supply.
Unless specifically excepted herein, all development must demonstrate proof of a legal water supply. Verification requirements for the water supply are set forth in this section. Development that fails to demonstrate an adequate legal supply to meet its water demand at full buildout shall not be approved.
1.
Service by existing
public water provider
or
designated regional public water provider
.
a.
Adequate legal water supply for the
development
may be established as follows:
a.
At project submittal, written confirmation from an existing public water provider or designated regional public water provider stating that such provider has the physical and legal capacity to serve the development and is willing to provide a water supply sufficient for build-out of the proposed development, including the information required in paragraph IV.A below if applicable.
b.
Signed commitments of firm water delivery (such as a perpetual, non-revocable tap reservation) or evidence of tap purchases from the existing public water provider or designated regional public water provider prior to permit issuance or final plat recording.
b.
Requirement to connect to water system.
a.
General requirement, all development within four hundred (400) feet of a water main of a public water system or designated regional public water system shall connect to such system, unless the applicable provider certifies, in writing, that the system lacks sufficient capacity to serve the development; or the connection would be technically impracticable; or the provider otherwise refuses to serve the development.
b.
The distance from the development to the applicable water main shall be measured in a direct line from the nearest point on the development’s property line to any water main of the applicable provider’s distribution system.
2.
Other development. For development proposing service by any means other than an existing public water system or by a designated regional public water provider, a legal water supply may be established at project submittal through verification, by the Colorado State Engineer's Office, Division of Water Resources, of the applicant's water rights and/or permanent water well permit and any augmentation plan(s) or other decreed water rights. For subdivisions, legal water shall be established by providing a well permit for the well that was used to verify physical water supply per subsection IV below, as well as positive comments from the Colorado State Engineer's Office, Division of Water Resources that the remainder of the subdivision has the ability to obtain well permits in the future. Plans relying on a temporary or substitute water supply shall be deemed not to meet the requirements of this section.
G.
Criteria for verification of physical water supply.
At project submittal, all development subject to these provisions, except for accessory uses with no additional water demand, shall demonstrate a water supply adequate to meet the development’s estimated demand rate, as calculated pursuant to subsection II above, according to the following standards.
1.
Service by existing public water provider or designated regional public water provider for developments with demand exceeding 9,750 gallons per day. For developments exceeding 9,750 gallons per day proposing to use water from an existing public water provider or designated regional public water provider, written confirmation that the provider has the physical capacity to serve the development and is willing to provide a water supply sufficient for build-out. Such written confirmation must be provided in a report or letter prepared by a professional engineer or by a water supply expert, acceptable to the county, from the public water or designated regional public water provider and must include the following:
a.
An estimate of the water demand requirements for the development through build-out conditions.
b.
A description of the physical source of water supply to be used to serve the development.
c.
An estimate of the amount of water yield projected from the proposed water supply under various hydrologic conditions.
d.
The present demand on the water provider and the anticipated demand due to commitments for service entered into but not yet supplied.
e.
The amount of uncommitted firm supply the provider has available for future commitment and development.
f.
Water conservation measures, if any, that may be implemented within the development.
g.
Water demand management measures, if any, that may be implemented to account for hydrologic variability.
h.
A summary of the water rights owned and controlled by the provider.
The specific requirements set forth in this paragraph IV.A may be waived by the county’s planning engineer if a water supply plan is on file with the county for the applicable water provider and such plan has been reviewed and updated, if appropriate, within the past ten (10) years by the governing board of the public water provider or designated regional public water provider, has a minimum twenty (20) year planning horizon and otherwise meets the requirements of C.R.S. § 29-20-304, as amended from time to time.
2.
Groundwater. For development proposing to use groundwater from a source other than an existing public water provider or designated regional public water provider subject to paragraph IV.A, aquifer data and/or testing shall be required, the scope and duration of which shall be determined based upon the development’s estimated water demand. For phased development, when the cumulative water demand of any previously approved phase(s) and/or the current proposed phase meets or exceeds any of the tiered thresholds set forth in this paragraph IV.B, the applicant shall establish adequate water supply by completing additional tests or reports (i.e. well aquifer constant-rate tests or a comprehensive hydrogeologic report, based on aquifer testing and a water balance estimate), as appropriate.
a.
Basic standards for adequate supply. An adequate water supply for the
development
shall be demonstrated through satisfaction of the following and other applicable criteria set forth in this paragraph IV.B:
a.
Recovery data demonstrates the water level recovered to within ninety (90) percent of the total drawdown within two (2) times of the pumping duration during the aquifer test. If recovery is deficient, a professional engineer or a professional geologist may provide supplemental data to demonstrate adequate recharge to the well.
b.
Pumping rates do not vary more than ten (10) percent over the duration of the test.
c.
The well can maintain a minimum average pumping rate of two and two-tenths (2.2) gpm over the prescribed duration of pumping.
b.
Development with estimated demand of one thousand fifty (1,050) gpd or less. For development with an estimated water demand of one thousand fifty (1,050) gpd or less, the applicant shall provide the following information and/or perform the following testing:
a.
For development of additional dwelling units subject to director determination approval pursuant to subparagraph 66-4.I.A or minor permit approval pursuant to subparagraph 66-6.I.B, for which an existing well (whether an individual groundwater well or a micro water system) has been in operation for one (1) year or more and is located on a portion of the development, and where the anticipated development will not increase the water demand of current uses, the applicant shall provide:
i.
A copy of the well’s pump installation report.
ii.
A copy of the well’s
construction
and test report, or a statement from a well driller, pump installer,
professional engineer
or
professional geologist
who has constructed, serviced, or tested the well, describing the well's production capabilities.
If the information listed above is not available, or if it indicates the well may not be capable of producing a minimum sustainable yield of two and two-tenths (2.2) gpm, the applicant shall perform a single well aquifer constant-rate test according to the specifications set forth below in subparagraph IV.B.2.b.
b.

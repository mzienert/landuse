shall convene on the first four Tuesdays of the month in regular meetings at the
county
seat of the county, unless otherwise scheduled. Under certain circumstances, regular meetings may be canceled, postponed or held in another location if the public interest may require. The Board may also convene on other days in special or emergency meetings, and in other locations within the county as, in the opinion of the Board, the public interest may require.
At regular, special or emergency meetings, the board may adopt policies, positions, resolutions, rules, regulations and ordinances and take formal action on matters and transact other county business, properly noticed pursuant to C.R.S. §§ 24-6-401 et seq., as amended.
Minutes at any regular, special or emergency meetings of the Board, at which the adoption of any proposed policy, position, resolution, rule, regulation, ordinance or formal action occurs or could occur shall be taken and promptly recorded, and such records shall be open to public inspection. Minutes of a meeting during which a duly authorized executive session is held shall reflect the general topic of the discussion at the executive session.  All regular, special and emergency meetings of the Board shall be open to the public.

The Board reserves the right to set work/study sessions on any day by posting notice thereof in accordance with C.R.S. § 24-6-401 et seq. as amended. Work/study sessions shall be for the purpose of meeting with staff or the public to review matters of county business, receive reports, discuss items of current interest, day-to-day oversight of property and supervision of employees. No formal action shall be taken at a work/study session and no minutes shall be taken. All work sessions of the Board shall be open to the public.
III.
Pursuant to the provisions of C.R.S.§ 24-6-402, the Board may, upon affirmative vote of two members of the Board, and after public announcement of the purpose including the specific citation to the provision of the state statute authorizing an executive session, hold an executive session only at a regular or special meeting and for the sole purpose of considering the purchase, acquisition, lease, transfer or sale of any real, personal or other property interests; conferences with an attorney to receive legal advice on specific legal issues; matters required to be kept confidential by federal or state law, rules or regulations; specialized details of security arrangements or investigations; determining positions relative to matters that may be subject to negotiations, developing strategy for negotiations, and instructing negotiators; consideration of personnel matters except if the employee who is the subject of the session has requested an open meeting, or if the personnel matter involves more than one employee, and all of the employees have requested an open meeting provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to discussions concerning any member of the local public body, any elected official or the appointment of a person to fill the office of a member of the local public body or an elected official or to discussions of personnel policies that do not require the discussion of matters personal to particular employees; or consideration of any documents protected by the mandatory nondisclosure provisions of the Open Records Act. No adoption of any proposed policy, position, resolution, rule, regulation, ordinance or formal action shall occur at such executive session.  The motion to move to executive session must also include identification of the particular matter to be discussed in as much detail as possible without compromising the purpose for which the executive session is authorized.  All executive sessions shall be audio recorded provided, however, if, in the opinion of the county attorney, all or a portion of the discussion during the executive session constitutes a privileged attorney-client communication, then that portion of the executive session may not be recorded, at the discretion of the Board of County Commissioners.

VII.
The County Manager is hereby directed to prepare a schedule showing all meeting times and items of business to be discussed or considered by the Board not less than twenty-four (24) hours (weekends excluded) in advance of any such meeting.  For example, when a Board meeting is to be held on a Monday at 10:00 a.m., such schedules shall be available to the press and public no later than 10:00 a.m. on the preceding Friday.

The Loss Control & Safety Committee (Committee) represents equal ownership between departments regarding county safety, loss control, and health. The committee reflects the unity of effort that is coordinated and integrated among all county employees. The committee is meant to enhance county safety practices, policies, and procedures, while also mitigating safety risks. The committee assists in protecting county assets (personnel, equipment, property, data, intellectual assets, etc.) and mitigating losses where possible. The committee is supported by the safety-first commitment of supervisors, department heads, and elected officials.

Sec. 2-97. Committee Membership
Committee membership is composed of employees from departments and divisions designated by the risk manager to represent the different classes and working conditions in the county employee base. Committee members are selected for their interest and expertise regarding departmental safety standards and are appointed by their elected official or department head. Committee members are deemed safety coordinators for their respective department and will serve as the point of contact for safety-related matters for their department. If a safety coordinator is not available to fulfill his/her duties or elects to withdraw membership from the committee, the safety coordinator’s department head or elected official, in collaboration with the risk manager, is responsible for designating a backup, interim, or replacement safety coordinator.
All committee members and guests are required to review and sign a committee confidentiality agreement before attending their first committee meeting.

The Accident Review Committee can review, as needed, all accidents and incidents involving injury to county employees; injury to third parties while utilizing county property; damage to county property, damage to third-party property or equipment due to an accident or incident involving a county employee, property, or equipment; and/or motor vehicle accidents involving county-owned vehicles or personal vehicles operated by county employees while conducting official county business.
2.
The employees involved in the accident, if any, may be given notice of the time and place of the review, and may be entitled to attend, give testimony, and present such witnesses or evidence as they so desire. Testimony is not sworn. However, the Accident Review Committee may record the proceedings, at which time all parties present will be so advised. Failure of a county employee involved in an accident to attend, after receiving notice of such accident review, shall not be cause for the Accident Review Committee to discontinue its review.
3.
The Accident Review Committee makes a recommendation for corrective action, when applicable, to the appropriate Elected Official or Department Head after it concludes the review and findings. The County Manager receives a copy of the recommendation. The Accident Review Committee does not have the authority to impose employment disciplinary action on its own accord.
4.
Within 15 business days after the receipt of a recommendation, the Elected Official or Department Head must respond to and agree or disagree with the recommendation, citing the reason(s) why, and specifying any subsequent action(s) taken, if any.
5.
If, upon review of the accident, the Committee concludes that future accidents can be prevented through the change of policies or procedures, it will so advise the County Manager.

Sec. 2-101. Corrective or Disciplinary Action
If warranted, the appropriate Department Head, Elected Official, or designee shall take appropriate action under the County corrective or disciplinary action practices to prevent the recurrence of an accident or safety violation, as identified by the Committee. All recommendations of the Committee, other than a recommendation for dismissal of the employee involved, are intended to be corrective in nature to reduce the county’s liability for accidents, damage to county property, and/or employee injuries and illnesses. There should be a reasonable relationship between the offense that occurred and the recommendation. The Committee may recommend that a disciplinary action include requiring the at-fault employee to reimburse the county’s financial losses suffered, within reason and in accordance with labor laws. Any disciplinary action recommended will be done so in accordance with the terms of county personnel policies and procedures.

The standard of prudence to be used for managing the

shall
exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the
management
of the property of another, not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of capital." (C.R.S. § 15-1-304, Standard for Investments.)
The county's overall investment program shall be designed and managed with a degree of professionalism that is worthy of the public trust. The county recognizes that no investment is totally without risk and that the investment activities of the county are a matter of public record. Accordingly, the county recognizes that occasional measured losses
may
occur in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall portfolio's return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented and that the sale of a security is in the best long-term interest of the county.
The county treasurer and other authorized
persons
acting in accordance with written procedures and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes.

county
treasurer any material financial interest they have in financial institutions that conduct business with the county, and they shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of the county.

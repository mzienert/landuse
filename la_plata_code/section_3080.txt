Chapter 68 Planned Unit Developments
Sec. 68-3 Overview of PUD procedure
PUD projects require consideration by the county of a PUD sketch plan, PUD preliminary plan, and if applicable final plat for subdivision within the approved PUD, in that order. Unless a phasing plan was approved as part of a sketch plan, a conceptual development plan as provided in section 66-29 is required when development is proposed in phases. Each step is a distinct process involving the submittal of an application, an application fee, required plans and reports, referral of the proposal to other agencies, staff analysis, work sessions and public meetings. Approval of any application in the process does not ensure approval of the next application.

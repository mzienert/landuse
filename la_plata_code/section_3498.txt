Sec. 90-9 Additional submittal requirements: hydraulic fracturing treatment
If an operator proposes to drill a well at a depth less than two thousand (2,000) feet true vertical depth below the surface that will be subject to hydraulic fracturing treatment, the operator shall:
I.
Characterize and assess the local geology and groundwater resources within two (2) miles of the proposed oil and gas well.
II.
Describe the proposed drilling process, well design, completion process, hydraulic fracturing treatment process, production methods and facilities.  The assessment will identify any risks to geology and hydrogeology and explain how the operator will prevent, minimize and mitigate any identified risk.
III.
Describe how hydraulic fracturing treatment fluids will be disposed of and, if applicable, temporarily stored on-site.

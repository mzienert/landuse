La Plata County Weed Management and Enforcement Plan Weed Lists
“A” List Weeds
State “A” Listed Weeds: All populations of the current State “A” List species are designated for eradication. State “A” List species must be eradicated in accordance with all the provisions of the applicable state noxious weed management plans.
La Plata County Goal 1 Weeds (Elevated Status to County “A” List Weeds): In addition to the State “A” List, the following highlighted State “B” List weeds are also designated for eradication in La Plata County as Goal 1 (or, “A “List) weeds.
While the
yellow highlighted
weeds are State “B List” weeds, their populations are rare or non-existent in La Plata County, therefore eradication is feasible. Thus, the eradication of such weeds is being prioritized by the County and the status is hereby elevated to the County “A” List. This “A” list designation prioritizes their eradication.

“B” List Weeds
State “B” Listed Weeds:
The following State “B” List Species are designated by the Commissioner for eradication or management wherever they are found. State B List species should be eradicated or managed in accordance with all the provisions of the applicable state noxious weed management plans.
Until a state noxious weed management plan for a particular species is developed and implemented by rule, all persons are recommended to manage that species pursuant to consultation with the Weed Office or pursuant to the management plan developed by the weed office and attached hereto.
La Plata County Goal 2 Weeds (Elevated Status to La Plata County “B” List Weeds):
In addition to the State “B” List Weeds set forth below, the following highlighted State “C” List weeds are also designated for eradication or management in La Plata County as Goal 2 (or,”B” List) weeds.
Size and Location:
All landowners and land managers with mandatory for eradication or management B List Weed Species will be required to implement the following minimal management strategies.
Isolated small populations of one acre or less (goal 1): Intensive best management practices applied with eradication goals in mind. Prevent seed formation and root spread on an annual basis
Satellite populations, one acre or less, (goal 1) proximate to larger populations (goal 2): Intensive best management practices applied with eradication goals in mind. Prevent seed formation and root spread on an annual basis. Large populations of more than one acre (goal 2): Use effective, best management practices. At a minimum, apply containment and perimeter buffering management of fifty feet wide each growing season. Prevent seed formation and root spread on an annual basis.
Containment and perimeter buffering/ reduction practices shall be stepped inward toward the center of the infestation at a minimum of fifty feet wide each season thereafter until the desired goals of the weed management plan have been met. Weed re-growth in previous buffers shall continue to be managed to prevent seed formation and root spread on an annual basis.
Priority Management Areas:
Infestations adjacent to property lines, easements, rights of ways, ditches, canals, streams, rivers, trails, wildlife migration routes, private and public roadways: Buffering will be required each growing season and applied to the entire perimeter of the infestation at a minimum of fifty feet wide at the proper timing in order to prevent seed formation and root spread. Annual stepped in buffering and reduction management will be required.
Weeds listed below are required (mandatory) management by the State of Colorado in La Plata County. All species on the B list are established in La Plata County.

Sec. 90-12 Additional standards applicable to flowlines and pipelines
I.
General requirements.
A.
Incorporation of
ECMC’
s minimum standards for flowlines. All flowlines shall comply with the minimum standards established by the ECMC for flowlines and crude oil transfer lines in ECMC’s flowline regulations (currently identified as the 1100 Series of Rules), as the same may be amended from time to time, including without limitation for: materials, design, installation, cover, top soil management, marking, inspection, maintenance, repair, operating requirements, corrosion control, record keeping, valves, integrity management, and abandonment, except a surface owner agreement allowing abandonment in place is necessary, but not sufficient, to support a request to abandon a pipeline in place.
B.
The decision-making body shall have discretion to grant or deny a request to abandon a pipeline in place based on all the factors identified in ECMC Rule 1105.d. All references to the ECMC’s director (such as submission of information to the director or decision to be made by the director) shall mean, for purposes of this section, the director. All references to the ECMC or commission shall mean, for purposes of this section, the decision-making body.
C.
Protective location.  All flowlines, off-location flowlines and pipelines transporting process materials, wastes, product and any other items used or generated by oil and gas operations shall, to the
maximum extent feasible
, be placed in the most protective location such as along property lines and shall be located to avoid existing building units; proposed building units as evidenced by a recorded plat, land use permit, building permit, or pending application for land use permit or building permit; surface waterbodies; designated open spaces; and designated outside activity areas.
D.
Boring.  To the maximum extent feasible, operators shall use boring technology when crossing streams, rivers, wetlands and irrigation ditches with a pipeline to minimize negative impacts to the channel, bank and
riparian areas
.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, open cuts may be used to cross irrigation ditches if the affected ditch company or owner approves of the technique.  All pipelines installed beneath a county road or public right-of-way shall be bored unless otherwise agreed to by the county engineer.
E.
Minimum depth.  The depth for all flowlines or pipelines buried within a county right-of-way or other public right-of-way shall be a minimum of six (6) feet below ground surface or the proposed roadway elevation, whichever is lower.  The depth for all pipelines outside of the county right-of-way shall be a minimum of thirty (30) inches, except on cropland all flowlines shall have a burial depth of no less than three (3) feet.
F.
Maintenance of existing vegetation.  During the construction phase, rather than scraping the surface, to the maximum extent practicable, the operator shall mow or brush hog vegetation to leave the root structure intact.
G.
Domestic taps.  The creation of new domestic taps is prohibited. The county encourages operators to decommission and remove existing domestic taps whenever and wherever possible.

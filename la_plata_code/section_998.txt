Overview
This
code
is premised upon
performance-based zoning
and the type of standards more particularly described in the overview of chapter 70. However, in the Animas Valley,
traditional zoning
has been adopted. This chapter contains detailed
use
,
density
and
lot
standards for
development
covered by the Animas Valley Land Use Plan (AVLUP). Applications for
development
in the Animas Valley should refer to this chapter to determine (1) if the proposed use is allowed and what type of review procedures apply, (2) what minimum
lot size
, maximum
density
, minimum
open space
and maximum
impervious coverage
standards may apply, and (3) whether any supplemental use,
density
and
development
standards are applicable because of the property’s location in the Animas Valley River Corridor District or one of several Animas Valley Neighborhood Overlay Zoning Districts.
This chapter is also intended to accommodate future placement of unique standards that may apply to economic
development
areas, once designated under section 66-38, or future overlay areas that may be adopted relative to requirements for
affordable housing
or other matters.
Sec. 65-1 Applicability
Unless otherwise excepted, the uses set forth in this chapter shall meet all applicable standards imposed by this section as well as the general and additional standards imposed by chapters 70 and 72-74. If the general and additional standards imposed by this code conflict with the applicable standards imposed by this section and cannot be read harmoniously with such standards, the standards in this chapter 65 shall control.

single-family residence
, uses that are customarily secondary to a single-family residence, including accessory uses, and other developments that do not require a land use permit as described in section 66-3 and other applicable provisions of this code.
2.
Any preexisting dwelling unit made nonconforming in terms of density shall enjoy the right of replacement unless the entire site is being redeveloped, at which time the entire site shall be made to conform to the plan.
3.
Uses made nonconforming shall enjoy the right to regular maintenance, repair and to some extent replacement and expansion, as provided in section 79-3.
4.
No new subdivisions shall occur on slopes of thirty (30) percent or greater. One (1) dwelling unit is permitted on any preexisting, legal lot of record lying on steep slopes. This subsection shall in no way supersede the county's geologic hazards map regulations.
5.

Sec. 65-4 Animas Valley overlay and special zoning districts
I.
Purpose and applicability.
The Animas Valley has a river corridor district and five (5) neighborhood overlay districts that were established in 1993. Specific standards and regulations were adopted and remain applicable to these districts. The purpose of this section is to address these standards and regulations. All standards set forth in this code, not in conflict with the Animas Valley River Corridor District or the neighborhood zoning district standards, shall apply within these districts, it being the intent of this code that the most restrictive standards shall apply. The standards of the neighborhood zoning districts shall be required standards for development within the respective district. Each neighborhood district is depicted on the county geographic information system mapping.

A.
Purpose. The Animas Valley River Corridor District was established in 1990 and is defined on the east side of the Animas River by the 100-year
floodplain
boundary, and on the west side by a five hundred (500) foot width from the river bank or the 100-year floodplain limit, whichever is closest to the river. The purpose of the corridor is, among other things, to:
1.
Reduce the private and public cost, property damage and safety threat of flooding by limiting the intensity and proximity of development near the river.
2.
Protect the unique
riparian areas
along the river.
3.
Provide a wildlife corridor.
4.
Preserve the
scenic corridor
within the Animas Valley by limiting building height, impervious cover and the type and intensity of land uses allowed for consideration.
B.
Uses permitted by right.
1.
Uses permitted by right in the river corridor district include one (1) dwelling unit per existing legal lot of record or per thirty-five (35) acres, whichever is less;
granny flats
; commercial livestock and agriculture-related operations, and accessory structures. No structure may locate within the floodway or within fifty (50) feet of the river bank.
2.
Existing, adjacent legal or
nonconforming lots
of record may be reconfigured through
boundary adjustments
with the following specifications:
a.
The resultant lots allow for no more
dwelling units
than originally allowed for on the parcels.
b.
The resulting lots are no smaller than twelve (12) acres.
c.
All
boundary adjustments
involving existing nonconforming lots of record must be accomplished by a plat meeting all requirements of section 67-9.IV of this code.
d.
The plat shall designate minimum building setbacks of fifty (50) feet from all property lines.
e.
It may be deemed necessary by the board of county commissioners to require specific
building envelopes
to be designated on the plat. Reasons for the requirement may include, but not be limited to: visual or other adverse impact on the river or road, adverse impact on wetlands, wildlife or agricultural operations.
C.
Special uses permitted by a minor land use permit.
1.
Special uses permitted by a minor land use permit in the river corridor district include:
bed and breakfasts
of no more than ten (10) guestrooms, plant nurseries, greenhouses, public and
quasi-public facilities
, professional offices and low-intensity, tourist-oriented recreational uses. Such uses shall be designed to reflect the rural and scenic quality of the Animas Valley.
2.
No property subdivision shall create lots smaller than twelve (12) acres. No structures shall locate within the floodway, and in no case shall a structure locate within fifty (50) feet of the Animas river bank. All outdoor storage shall be screened from view off site. Projects by special use permit that access Highway 550 shall be directed to consolidate and adequately improve selected intersections along the highway commensurate with development intensity. Providing an adequate means of internal circulation between sites shall also be encouraged so as to minimize turn movement conflicts along the highway. Parking shall be as required under section 70-18.

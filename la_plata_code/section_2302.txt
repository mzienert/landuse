animal
vaccinated against rabies by a veterinarian licensed by the State of Colorado, unless one of the following conditions exist:
A veterinarian licensed in Colorado may issue a written waiver exempting the dog or cat from a rabies vaccination, pursuant to C.R.S. § 25-4-607(2), as amended; or
If the dog or cat has inflicted a
bite
upon any person or other animal within the preceding ten (10) day period, the

of the dog or cat shall report such fact to a veterinarian, and no rabies vaccination shall be administered until after a ten (10) day observation period has elapsed.
Vaccinations administered by a licensed veterinarian in another state, and in compliance with the schedule provided herein, will be accepted for dogs or cats of new County residents who have relocated from another state.

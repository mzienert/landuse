Chapter 70: General Site Development Standards Applicable to All Development
Sec. 70-20 Signs
I.
Purpose
. This section’s purpose is to provide reasonable, consistent, content-neutral, and non-discriminatory standards for signs, whether on or off premise, which regulate signs’ construction, size, type location, and maintenance in the county’s unincorporated territory. Specifically, these standards are intended to:
A.
Enable easy and efficient identification of residences and businesses, and facilitate communication necessary for the conduct of business; and
B.
Promote signs’ compatibility with their natural and constructed surroundings; and
C.
Minimize conflicts between the principal uses of sites where signs are located, adjacent uses, and visibility for the traveling public; and
D.
Limit the size and number of signs and sign messages to the minimum reasonably necessary to accomplish the signs’ intended purpose; and
E.
Lessen the hazards, confusion, and visual clutter which may be caused by signs’ proliferation, improper placement or installation; illumination; and excessive height, area, or bulk; and
F.
Protect the public from those dangers that may arise from unsafe; unmaintained; or misleading signs.
II.
Applicability.
A.
Generally. Except as specifically exempted in paragraph II.B., or prohibited in paragraph II.C., all signs within the unincorporated areas of the county shall be in conformance with the standards set forth in this section. A proposed sign independent of a development application shall be in conformance with these standards, however no submittals or sign permit are required.
B.
Exempt signs. The following types of signs are exempt from these standards. Except as specifically provided below, the exempt signs listed in this section shall be illuminated only by indirect lighting.
1.
Signs less than six (6) square feet in area, provided that there is not more than one (1) such sign per individual business, parcel, lot, or group of contiguous lots under single ownership;
2.
Temporary signs, including temporary decorations, that are non-permanent and displayed on private property for not more than thirty (30) consecutive days; and up to no more than twice per calendar year for a total of no more than sixty (60) days during a calendar year;
3.
Traffic signs erected within public rights-of-way by a local, state, or federal government or agency for the purpose of controlling or directing traffic;
4.

Signs containing any blinking, flashing, fluttering, or intermittent lights, or other devices that create a change in color, brightness, or intensity of lighting;
7.
Obsolete signs. A sign that has become obsolete by location on property that is vacant and unoccupied for twelve (12) months or more, or by its nature as an exempted temporary sign under sub-paragraph II.B.2 above that has remained longer than allowed for exempt temporary signs shall be removed by the owner at the owner’s expense.
III.
Standards.
A.
When reviewed as part of a development application subject to this code, all signage shall be compatible pursuant to the applicable terms, conditions and compatibility criteria set forth in section 70-5.
B.
Measurement. Signs shall be measured, for the purpose of determining compliance with this code, as follows:
1.
Area.
a.
A sign's area measurement shall include its entire surface, including any non-structural trim, but shall not include its supports or any structures on which it is mounted.
b.
If a sign consists of a symbol or statutory, the entire surface area of the symbol or statutory which can be enclosed within a rectangle shall be measured as the sign's area.
c.
If a sign has two (2) or more faces, its area shall be calculated as the sum of the areas of each face.
2.
Height shall be measured from the ground level of any support, building, or structure on which the sign is located to the highest point of the sign.
C.
Maximum sign area. The maximum area of a single sign shall be determined as follows:
1.
Wall signs and freestanding signs shall not exceed one hundred fifty (150) square feet.
2.
Projecting signs shall not exceed an area greater than one-half (0.5) square foot per linear foot of the front or street façade of the building or structure on which they are mounted or width of space of the wall on which the sign is located, whichever is less.
3.
On residential lots no sign of any type shall exceed twenty-four (24) square feet.
D.
Aggregate area. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, the aggregate area of all signs on a single lot or parcel shall not exceed the lesser of:
1.
Two hundred (200) square feet;
2.
Two (2) square feet per linear foot of frontage along any public right-of-way. The sign area allocation applies to each public righ-of-way in the event there are multiple frontages, e.g. corner lots.
E.
Clearance and height.
1.
All signs shall have at least ten (10) feet of clearance from power lines.
2.
Wall signs and projecting signs shall not exceed the height of the building or structure on which they are painted, affixed, or mounted.
3.
Signs that project over public or private pedestrian walkways shall maintain a minimum clearance of eight and one half (8.5) feet.
4.
On residential lots no freestanding sign shall exceed five (5) feet in height.
5.
On nonresidential or mixed-use lots, no freestanding sign shall exceed twenty-five (25) feet in height.
F.
Sign setbacks. No setback is required for signs, so long as the sign placement does not interfere with, limit, or obstruct snow removal, easements, sight distance, or pedestrian clearances or otherwise impair the health, safety and welfare of the public.
G.
Reflecting paint or other materials is prohibited on signs located on residential lots.
H.
Lighting. These standards apply to both internally illuminated signs and signs illuminated by direct, exterior lighting.

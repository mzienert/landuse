R301.2.3 Snow loads. Section R301.2.3 of the 2015 International Residential Code is deleted and replaced with the following:
The design of roof systems and assemblies shall be designed using the snow load information contained in Table R301.2.3.  The information represented in Table R301.2.3 provides pounds per square foot snow load for areas and elevations in La Plata County.    This information can also be found by individual
parcel
of land on the La Plata County GIS maps.   Properties having more than one snow load shall
use
the higher load in the structural calculations.  Pursuant to section
18-35
(107.2(9)),
buildings
in regions with live loads of  80 pounds per square foot or more shall, at the discretion of the
building official
be required to be designed by a design professional.
In the design of buildings and
structures
,
consideration
shall be given to the following:
1.
Unbalanced loading of roofs.
2.
Drifting due to
adjacent
obstructions.
3.
Accumulations in valleys and adjacent to parapet walls and chimneys.
4.
Ice loads on cornices of at least one and one half times the roof snow load.
5.
Possible
impact
loadings from snow falling on structure from higher roofs.
6.
Effect on structure from dynamic loading caused by snow sliding off roof.
7.
Snow sliding off roof and dynamically loading sidewalls by being forced against same due to snow embankment adjacent to the structure.
8.
Protection of entrances, exits and windows from the danger of falling icicles and snow sliding off pitched roofs.
9.
Ice weight where it will refreeze on unheated overhangs after having melted and run off from portions of roofs with heat below same.
10.
Projections through the roof, such as ventilation and plumbing vents, which may be torn off or damaged by sliding snow.
11.
Gas meter locations must be positioned in areas where they are least effected by ice and snow accumulations from roofs above. Where gas meter shed and protections are required the structure must be designed to resist 1.4 times the snow load requirement for the land/structure
site
snow load.
12.
All exterior decks must be designed based on the snow load criteria and requirements for the
project
location. Structural design must take into consideration the weight of total accumulation, impact loading from roofs above, uplift and mechanical connections and soil/foundation capabilities.

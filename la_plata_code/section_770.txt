ARTICLE III. LODGING TAX
FOOTNOTE(S):
Editor's note—
The lodging tax levied in this article was adopted by referendum on November 3, 1987. Whereas the ballot question stated that in the event that any additional sales,
use
or lodging tax or state-wise tax on lodging
facilities
was enacted or levied after January 1, 1987, which in combination with the lodging tax authorized by the
board
's resolution adopting the two percent
county
lodger's tax, exceeded two percent, the tax under the county's resolution would be reduced by the amount that the total tax exceeded the two percent maximum, and whereas in 1987 the state increased its state lodger's tax, effecting a reduction in the county lodger's tax, therefore the county lodger's tax in this article has been revised to properly state the amount as 1.9 percent.

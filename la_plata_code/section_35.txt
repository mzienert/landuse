The Loss Control & Safety Committee (Committee) represents equal ownership between departments regarding county safety, loss control, and health. The committee reflects the unity of effort that is coordinated and integrated among all county employees. The committee is meant to enhance county safety practices, policies, and procedures, while also mitigating safety risks. The committee assists in protecting county assets (personnel, equipment, property, data, intellectual assets, etc.) and mitigating losses where possible. The committee is supported by the safety-first commitment of supervisors, department heads, and elected officials.

Committee membership is composed of employees from departments and divisions designated by the risk manager to represent the different classes and working conditions in the county employee base. Committee members are selected for their interest and expertise regarding departmental safety standards and are appointed by their elected official or department head. Committee members are deemed safety coordinators for their respective department and will serve as the point of contact for safety-related matters for their department. If a safety coordinator is not available to fulfill his/her duties or elects to withdraw membership from the committee, the safety coordinator’s department head or elected official, in collaboration with the risk manager, is responsible for designating a backup, interim, or replacement safety coordinator.

2.
The employees involved in the accident, if any, may be given notice of the time and place of the review, and may be entitled to attend, give testimony, and present such witnesses or evidence as they so desire. Testimony is not sworn. However, the Accident Review Committee may record the proceedings, at which time all parties present will be so advised. Failure of a county employee involved in an accident to attend, after receiving notice of such accident review, shall not be cause for the Accident Review Committee to discontinue its review.
3.
The Accident Review Committee makes a recommendation for corrective action, when applicable, to the appropriate Elected Official or Department Head after it concludes the review and findings. The County Manager receives a copy of the recommendation. The Accident Review Committee does not have the authority to impose employment disciplinary action on its own accord.
4.
Within 15 business days after the receipt of a recommendation, the Elected Official or Department Head must respond to and agree or disagree with the recommendation, citing the reason(s) why, and specifying any subsequent action(s) taken, if any.

DIVISION 3. WEED MANAGEMENT PLAN
Sec. 58-106 Integrated Weed Management Plans
C.R.S. § 35-5.5-104 requires all persons to use integrated methods (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "IM") to manage noxious weeds if the weeds are likely to be materially damaging to the land of neighboring landowners.  It is the intent of the BoCC to implement a coordinated program of integrated management. The purpose of integrated management is to achieve healthy and productive natural and agricultural ecosystems through a balanced program. This program will include, but not be limited to, education, prevention measures, good stewardship and control methods.
Integrated management is a strategy using a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to plant management. By viewing a problem in its entirety, one is better able to design a management plan that is safe, cost effective and gets results, without unreasonable damage to natural controls and the environment. An IM approach to weed management includes choosing from a variety of available weed control strategies and predicting their long term effects.
The major weed control tactics to be considered in an IM program are:
Education should be considered the number one priority (e.g., plant identification, life cycles, mapping infestations).
Prevention (e.g., eliminate undesirable plant seed dispersal, irrigation management, soil fertility, range management and minimizing disturbances to the landscape).
Mechanical and physical (e.g., cutting, mowing, burning, cultivation and cross fencing).
Cultural (e.g., crop rotation, rehabilitation by the establishment of competitive crops, grasses and mulching).
Biological (e.g., grazing, predators, parasites and pathogens).
Chemical (e.g., weed oils, nonselective and selective herbicides, and plant growth regulators).
While these tactics can be used singularly, they are usually most effective when used in combination. Once it is determined why the weeds are occurring in the first place, strategies can be developed not only to reduce existing weed populations and change the size of infestations, but also to prevent future weed problems.
The A, B and C Weed Lists annexed hereto and made a part hereof as Attachment A shall be utilized in the administration of the Management Plan pursuant to Chapter 58 of the La Plata County Code.

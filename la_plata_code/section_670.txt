DIVISION 4. HEIGHT, WEIGHT AND LENGTH LIMITS
Sec. 42-356. Gross weight of vehicles and loads.
No
vehicle
or combination of vehicles
shall
be moved or operated on any
roadway
or bridge when the gross weight thereof exceeds the limits specified below, unless such
county
road shall be posted with a lesser weight limit:
The gross weight upon any one axle of a vehicle shall not exceed the limits prescribed in section 42-355.
Subject to the limitations prescribed in section 42-355, the gross weight of a vehicle having two axles shall not exceed 36,000 pounds.
Subject to the limitations prescribed in section 42-355, the gross weight of a single vehicle having three or more axles shall not exceed 54,000 pounds.
Subject to the limitations prescribed in section 42-355, the maximum gross weight of any vehicle or combination of vehicles shall not exceed that determined by the formula W equals 1,000 (L plus 40), W equals the gross weight in pounds, L equals the length in feet between the centers of the first and last axles of such vehicle or combination of vehicles, but in computation of this formula, no gross vehicle weight shall exceed 85,000 pounds. For the purposes of this section, where a combination of vehicles is used, no vehicle shall carry a gross weight of less than ten percent of the overall gross weight of the combination of vehicles; except that these limitations shall not apply to specialized trailers of fixed public
utilities
whose axles
may
carry less than ten percent of the weight of the combination. The limitations provided in this section shall be strictly construed and enforced.

Sec. 78-51. Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator.
The duties and responsibilities of the
floodplain administrator
shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:
Review, approve, or deny all applications for
floodplain development permits
required by adoption of this chapter.
Review floodplain development permit applications to determine whether a proposed
building
site
, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding.
Review
permits
for proposed
development
to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control
Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required.
Inspect all development at appropriate times during the period of
construction
to ensure compliance with all provisions of this chapter, including proper elevation of the
structure
.
Interpretation of
floodplain
boundaries.
Where interpretation is needed as to the accurate location of the boundaries the
special flood hazard area
(for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretations.
If available, the
base flood elevation
as shown on the profiles and tabulations for the points in question shall be the governing factor in determining accurate boundaries and shall take precedence over the boundaries shown on the maps.
When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with subsection (V)(B) of this section, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, as criteria for requiring that
new construction
,
substantial improvements
or other development are administered in accordance with division 3 of this chapter.
Any
person
contesting the location of a floodplain boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the floodplain designation. Any boundary appeal must be substantiated by technical engineering data of sufficient detail to allow a determination to be made. The planning and building
departments
shall review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, both departments shall ensure that the encroachment provisions of division 3 of this chapter are met.
Information to be obtained and maintained. The floodplain administrator shall:
Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.
Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to
mean sea level
) of the
lowest floor
(including the
basement
) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement.
For all new or substantially improved
flood
proofed structures:
Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level to which the structure has been flood proofed); and
Maintain the
flood proofing
certifications required in this chapter.
Notification. Notify adjacent
communities
and the state water conservation
board
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to
FEMA
.
Maintenance. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

Sec. 78-52. Application requirements.
Information submittals. In
addition
to the regular
development
review requirements, a
floodplain development permit
shall
be obtained before
construction
or development begins within any
area of special flood hazard
established in division 1 of this article. Application for a floodplain development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the
floodplain administrator
and
may
include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevations of the area in question; the location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations; existing and proposed
structures
, including the placement of manufactured homes; fill, storage of materials, and drainage
facilities
; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:
Location of
site
(distance upstream as per
floodplain
studies);
Building
site elevation (in relation to the
mean sea level
);
Difference between the building site elevation and the stream bed elevation;
Elevation, in relation to the mean sea level, of the
lowest floor
(including the
basement
) of all new and substantially improved structures;
Elevation in relation to the mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure shall be
flood
proofed;
Description of any construction activity that would affect the hydraulic capacity of the
base flood
perimeters;
Certification by a registered
professional engineer
or architect that the
flood proofing
methods for any nonresidential structure meet the flood proofing criteria in section 78-73;
Other information requested by the floodplain administrator; and
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
Preparation of submittals. The information contained in subsection (I) of this section shall be prepared and certified by a professional engineer, registered in the state. Required elevation data may be provided by a registered land surveyor.
Information to be kept on file. Whenever an
applicant
is required to prepare and submit
base flood elevation
data in areas designated on the FIRM on an approximate A zone, the applicant shall also submit all underlying data and engineering calculations. Such information shall be kept on file for
use
pursuant to section
78-51.
(Res. No. 2014-30, § 1(Exh. A), 8-5-2014)
Effective on: 8/5/2014
Sec. 78-53. Application approval or denial.
Approval or denial of a
floodplain development permit
by the
floodplain administrator
shall
be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors:
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
The susceptibility of the proposed
facility
and its contents to
flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner
;
The danger that materials
may
be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The compatibility of the proposed
use
with existing and anticipated
development
;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency
vehicles
;
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave
action
, if applicable, expected at the
site
;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
The relationship of the proposed use to any comprehensive plan, master plan or
floodplain management
program for that area, if applicable.
For waterways with
base flood elevations
for which a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no
new construction
,
substantial improvements
, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the
county
FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and reasonably anticipated development, will not increase the
water surface elevation
of the
base flood
more than one-half foot at any point within the county.
Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, as amended, the floodplain administrator may approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the county's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one-half foot, provided that the
applicant
first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through
FEMA
(conditional letter of map revision), fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of 44 CFR § 65.12 and receives FEMA approval.

Sec. 78-54. Variance procedure.
Appeals
board
.
A
board of appeals
consisting of the board of
county
commissioners
is hereby established to hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances
from the requirements of this chapter.
The board of appeals
shall
hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the
floodplain administrator
in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
Those aggrieved by the decision of the board of appeals
may
seek judicial review of such decision pursuant to C.R.C.P. 106(a)(4).
In passing upon such applications, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this chapter, including but not limited to section
78-53.
Upon consideration of the factors of this article and the purposes of this chapter, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this chapter.
Conditions for variances.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures
upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure
's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, with regard to the procedures set forth in this section.
A variance shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood
levels during the
base flood
discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant
; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or regulations.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure may be permitted to be built with a
lowest floor
elevation below the
base flood elevation
and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
Generally, variances may be issued for
new construction
and
substantial improvements
to be erected on a
lot
of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the provisions of section 78-53 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justifications required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued by the floodplain administrator for new construction and substantial improvements and for other
development
necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use
provided that:
The criteria outlined in this section are met, and
The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
Record of variances. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all
actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to
FEMA
upon request.

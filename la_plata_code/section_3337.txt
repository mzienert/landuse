standard purchase
procedures outlined in article III are followed.
Specific authority for other procurement functions and
contract amendments
and

are set forth throughout this code.
II.
Contract approval.

that exceeds the delegated signature authority in accordance with the county’s Fiscal Management Policy No. III 4, as amended.
B.

Certain purchases are of such a nature that the county’s need and ability to properly use the item or

procurement
method followed, including a
small purchase
, comments from or signature approval of the appropriate department head, as set forth below, shall be obtained prior to
solicitation
. This approval indicates that the purchase is compatible with but not duplicative of existing county resources. Additional department head purchase approval is required in the following instances:
I.
Technology purchases
including computer hardware, copy machines and software, regardless of price, must be reviewed by the director of the county’s information technology (“IT”) department, or the director’s designee, prior to solicitation or purchase, in the case of a small purchase. The IT director will review each request to determine all systems issues, including compatibility, support, architectural standards, and implementation and integration capabilities. When no systemic issues are presented, the IT director’s approval should be reflected in the
purchase requisition
or other documentation. When the IT director expresses concerns over a proposed solicitation or purchase, the county manager may either approve or deny a department’s or elected official’s proposed technology purchase.
II.
Professional services involving county facilities

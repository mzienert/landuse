Chapter 44. Impact Fees
Division 2: Road Impact Fees
Sec. 44-27 Refunds.
I.
Eligibility for refund.
Refunds may be requested by an applicant who paid the impact fee in the following circumstances:
A.
The
building permit
or
qualifying land use permit
upon which the impact fee was imposed, calculated and collected expired or was revoked prior to the
commencement of construction
or use; and the funds paid have not yet been appropriated at the time of a complete application for refund; and a new building permit or qualifying land use permit will be needed to develop the property; or
B.
The county failed to appropriate the impact fees paid by the applicant in compliance with the timing or other applicable requirements of subsection 44-26.III; or
C.
The applicant amends its building permit or qualifying land use permit to reduce the amount of development after the building permit or qualifying land use permit was issued and after the impact fee was paid, provided that the impact fee was not appropriated; or
D.
The
new development
(1) obtains a certificate of occupancy from the
community development department
for one or more
dwelling units
; (2) applicant submits written proof to the community development department that such unit(s) is deemed to be a qualified affordable or
attainable housing
unit(s) through participation in one of the programs identified in paragraph 44-22.II.C above; and (3) the funds paid have not yet been appropriated at the time of a complete application for refund.
II.
Procedure for making refunds.
All requests for refunds shall be made by the current owner of the property on a refund application form provided by the community development department. The applicant must submit the following: a title report showing the applicant is the current owner of the property; proof that an impact fee was paid (i.e., a receipt or comparable evidence); and evidence that one (1) of the circumstances set forth in subsection 44-27.I, above occurred. To demonstrate compliance with paragraph 44-27.I.D, the applicant must provide verification from the La Plata County Regional Housing Alliance that the new development is participating in an identified affordable/attainable housing program and the specific dwelling unit(s) for which the refund is requested are qualified as affordable or attainable units and not market-rate units.
The community development department shall review the refund application form and the documentary evidence submitted and, within thirty (30) days following receipt of a completed refund application form, make a determination of whether a refund is due. The determination of the community development department shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the determination. Refunds may be authorized by direct payment to the applicant or by other appropriate means. The refunded fees shall be taken from the account into which the impact fee funds were originally placed. In the event fees become refundable due to the county’s failure to appropriate impact fees in compliance with the timing or other applicable requirements of subsection 44-26.III, the county shall cause a notice of the availability of such refund to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the county and such notice shall be prominent and published in a section of the newspaper other than the section reserved for legal advertisements or notices.

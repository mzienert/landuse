DIVISION 4. HEIGHT, WEIGHT AND LENGTH LIMITS
Sec. 42-357. Vehicles weighed; excess removed.
Any law enforcement officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle
and load is unlawful is authorized to require the driver to
stop
and submit to a weighing of the vehicle by means of either portable or stationary scales or
shall
require that such vehicle be driven to the nearest public scales in the event such scales are within five miles.
Except as provided in this subsection, whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load as provided in subsection (I) of this section, determines that the weight is unlawful, such officer shall require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as
may
be necessary to reduce the gross weight of such vehicle to such limit as permitted under this article. All material so unloaded shall be cared for by the
owner or operator
of such vehicle at the risk of such owner or operator. Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load as provided in subsection (I) of this section, determines that the weight is unlawful and the load consists solely of either explosives or hazardous materials as defined in C.R.S. § 42-1-102(32), such officer shall
permit
the driver of such vehicle to proceed to his destination without requiring him to unload the excess portion of such load.
It is unlawful for any driver of a vehicle to fail or refuse to stop and submit the vehicle and load to a weighing or to fail or refuse when directed by an officer upon a weighing of the vehicle to stop the vehicle and otherwise comply with the provisions of this section.

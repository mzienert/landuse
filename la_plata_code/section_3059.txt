I.
Applicability.
Section 66-6 establishes the land uses and development activities that are subject to approval of a minor land use permit. A sketch plan pursuant to section 66-19 for a proposed development is an optional step and may precede an application for a minor land use permit. A sketch plan is a conceptual level to evaluate the basic design and suitability of the project. The minor land use permit requires the submittal of detailed engineered plans and exact locations of all activities and uses.

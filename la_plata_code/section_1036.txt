Sec. 68-1 Purpose
The purpose of a planned unit development is to encourage innovation and flexibility and to facilitate a mix of uses in the development of a balanced community which cannot be accommodated under the provisions of this code but remain compatible with the site’s physical and environmental characteristics, in accordance with C.R.S. § 24-67-101
et seq
. The intent is to create high quality residential, mixed-use, commercial or industrial development and employment centers and to allow greater flexibility in project design in return for greater development quality, amenities, a public benefit and protection of nearby properties from adverse impacts of new development. A PUD creates a custom zone district with its own standards, restrictions and uses.

Sec. 68-2 Applicability
This chapter applies to applications to designate a new PUD and, subject to section 68-8 below, PUDs existing prior to the effective date of this code. A PUD designation is primarily intended for use on a parcel or parcels of property that consists of a minimum of ten (10) acres. An applicant may request a PUD designation for a parcel that consists of less than ten (10) acres if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the PC during PUD sketch plan review that the proposed development would not negatively affect surrounding uses and the PUD would result in a greater benefit to the community than would development under conventional methods. A PUD designation should not be granted solely to permit variances for development of a single lot, building or use.
No PUD may be approved without the written consent of all owners whose properties are included within the PUD.
If a PUD consists of individual lots, subdivision plat or exemption plat approval shall also be required.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in an approved PUD guide, all development of real property pertaining to a PUD shall conform with this code. If the PUD guide is silent concerning a standard, restriction or requirement but this code is not, this code shall control. If the PUD guide conflicts with this code, the PUD guide shall control.

Sec. 68-3 Overview of PUD procedure
PUD projects require consideration by the county of a PUD sketch plan, PUD preliminary plan, and if applicable final plat for subdivision within the approved PUD, in that order. Unless a phasing plan was approved as part of a sketch plan, a conceptual development plan as provided in section 66-29 is required when development is proposed in phases. Each step is a distinct process involving the submittal of an application, an application fee, required plans and reports, referral of the proposal to other agencies, staff analysis, work sessions and public meetings. Approval of any application in the process does not ensure approval of the next application.

Sec. 68-4 Sketch plan
I.
Purpose
. An applicant proposing to develop a PUD shall obtain approval for a sketch plan pursuant to the procedures and standards of this chapter. The purpose of the sketch plan review is for the applicant, the county and the public to evaluate and discuss the basic concepts for development of the proposed PUD and to consider whether the development of the real property as a PUD will result in a significant improvement over its development as a conventional subdivision. Where appropriate, the sketch plan process may also examine alternative approaches to development of the property. Typically, a proposal will evolve during sketch plan review.
II.
Sketch plan review and considerations
. At sketch plan, the decision-making body shall determine whether the proposed PUD substantially complies with this code and is in general conformance with the comprehensive plan. In addition to addressing applicable standards, the applicant and the county shall reach general agreement on matters such as, but not limited to, the following:
A.
The types of use;
B.
Applicable site development standards, including dimensional standards, or variations thereof;
C.
The general locations intended for development and the areas planned to remain undeveloped, including open space;
D.
The general plan for phasing of the development and any infrastructure or other improvements;
E.
The general alignment for access;
F.
The provision of an adequate water supply and whether the water supply and sewage disposal will be provided through on-site water and wastewater treatment systems or through connection to public systems;
G.
Compatibility with the natural environment and the way natural hazards will not be increased as a result of the development;
H.
Compatibility with the existing uses of adjacent properties and other lands that may be significantly impacted.
III.
Sketch plan outcome.
The outcome of sketch plan review should be a finding on the project’s compatibility as well as an identification of issues and concerns the applicant must address for the project to be considered ripe for review by the decision-making body.
IV.
Sketch plan submittal requirements.
In addition to the general land use permit application submittal requirements set forth in section 66-11, applicant shall submit the following documents and materials:
A.
If the applicant is not the sole owner of all real property proposed to be included within the PUD, written consent from every owner of real property proposed to be included within the PUD, including identification of the applicant as an agent on behalf of each owner;
B.
The reasons why the PUD procedure is more desirable than the conventional subdivision or land use process;
C.
Proposed land uses; commercial, industrial and multi-family building locations; residential densities and commercial square footage;
D.
Proposed vehicle circulation pattern;
E.
Proposed pedestrian circulation pattern;
F.
Proposed open space;
G.
Narrative explanation of proposed land use restrictions;
H.
Any or all the following requirements, as determined by the director, based on the complexity of the proposal:
1.
Proposed schedule of development phasing;
2.
Statement of estimated demands on county services;
3.
Statement as to the impact of the proposed PUD on county school systems;
4.
Conceptual site plans and conceptual architectural plans;
5.
Proposed method of fire protection including information demonstrating a legal, adequate water supply for fire-fighting purposes.
V.
Sketch plan review and action
. The submission of an application for a PUD sketch plan, determination of compliance, staff and agency review and notice and scheduling of the hearing for the application shall comply with the procedures in section 66-11. The process for review of the PUD sketch plan application by the planning commission shall be as set forth in section 66-19. Except where the purposes set forth in section 68-1 may be furthered, the sketch plan shall be reviewed for general consistency with the approval criteria stated in section 66-16, but not for detailed compliance with development standards referenced in such criteria. The county may confer with the applicant on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of changes. No PUD sketch plan may be approved without the written consent of all owners whose real property is included within the PUD.
VI.
Effect of approval of sketch plan for PUD
.
A.
Limitation on approval. Approval of a PUD sketch plan shall authorize the applicant to submit to the CDD an application for a PUD preliminary plan. It shall not constitute final approval for the PUD. PUD sketch plan approval vests no development or vested rights.
B.
Expiration of approval. Approval of the sketch plan shall be null and void and automatically revoked two (2) years after the date of the board’s approval of the sketch plan, unless, prior to such expiration, an application for a preliminary plan for the PUD is submitted to the CDD and deemed complete by the director.
C.
Extension of sketch plan approval. One (1) extension of time up to one (1) year may be approved by the director upon written request when deemed necessary to resolve review comments or due to unforeseen circumstances. The owner shall submit a written request for extension to the CDD no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date the sketch plan is set to expire. The director’s approval of the extension shall be set forth in writing and shall clearly state the new sketch plan expiration date.

F.
Recordation. Subsequent to approval of a resolution approving a PUD preliminary plan, the applicant shall file with the county clerk and recorder the resolution, approved preliminary plan, PUD guide and any applicable supplementary agreements. Such instruments shall be binding on all owners, successors and assigns and shall constitute the development regulations and custom zones for the real property. Development of the real property shall be limited to the uses, density, configuration and all other elements and conditions set forth on the PUD preliminary plan, the PUD guide and any supplemental agreements. Failure of the applicant to record the PUD resolution, PUD preliminary plan, PUD guide and any supplemental agreements within thirty (30) days shall render the resolution, PUD preliminary plan, PUD guide and supplemental agreements null and void and the property shall no longer be subject to the approval and its conditions, if applicable.
IV.
Effect of approval of preliminary plan for PUD.
A.
Effect. Recordation of a PUD preliminary plan shall constitute establishment of a custom zone district for the real property subject to the PUD with its own standards, restrictions and uses.
B.
Subdivision plat. Following approval and recordation of the PUD preliminary plan, the applicant may apply for final plat for subdivision, in compliance with the requirements of section 67-3.
C.
Length of approval. Single-phase PUD preliminary plans are valid for five (5) years from the date of approval by the board. Multi-phase PUD preliminary plans are valid for ten (10) years from the date of approval by the board, though development of at least the first phase must be completed within five (5) years of the date of approval.
D.
Extension of approval. One (1) extension of time up to one (1) year may be approved by the director upon the applicant’s written request when deemed necessary to resolve review comments or due to unforeseen circumstances. With the written consent of all owners whose real property is included within the PUD, one extension of time up to three (3) years may be approved by the board due to conditions beyond the applicant’s control, including economic cycles and market conditions. The applicant shall submit a written request for extension to the CDD no later than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of the PUD preliminary plan or prior to the end of the first five (5) years after approval with respect to a request to extend the deadline for completing the first phase of a multi-phase PUD preliminary plan.
E.
Minor deviations or adjustments. Authorized minor deviations or adjustments from the PUD preliminary plan may be approved by the director or, in instances relating to access or roads, the planning engineer. All changes not qualifying for minor deviations or an adjustment shall be considered amendments and shall comply with this chapter.
Authorized minor deviations or adjustments are as follows:
1.
Those that are necessary in light of technical or engineering considerations first discovered during actual development and not reasonably anticipated during the initial approval process, if they comply with the established land use regulations;
2.
Technical survey errors as described in C.R.S. § 38-51-111 provided an affidavit of correction is prepared by a surveyor unless the county surveyor determines that a revised plat is necessary;
3.
Reconfiguration of snow load areas or parking areas resulting in no net loss of required spaces;
4.
Increased compliance with any voluntary guidelines.
V.
Amendment to PUD preliminary plan.
No PUD preliminary plan may be amended by an individual property owner without the written consent of the governing body of the homeowners’ association or property owners’ association that manages the PUD. The homeowners’ association or property owners’ association, with a majority vote of its constituents, may apply for a PUD amendment on behalf of all individual property owners of the land subject to the conditions and standards of the PUD to be amended. Amendments to the PUD preliminary plan shall be considered at a public hearing called and held in accordance with the provisions of C.R.S. § 24-67-104(1)(e). The applicant shall provide notice to every property owner within the PUD and all adjacent property owners as required in section 66-14. No substantial modification, removal or release of the provisions of the PUD preliminary plan or PUD guide shall be permitted except upon a finding by the board, that:
A.
Modification. The modification, removal or release is consistent with the efficient development and preservation of the entire PUD.
B.
Special benefit. The PUD amendment is not granted solely to confer a special benefit upon any person.
C.
Consistent with original approval. The amendment, extension, variation or alteration is pursuant to the standards and procedures established for its original approval.
D.

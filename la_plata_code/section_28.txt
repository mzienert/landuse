Pursuant to the provisions of C.R.S. §§ 24-6-402, the
board
may
, upon affirmative vote of two members of the board, and after public announcement of the purpose including the specific citation to the provision of the state statute authorizing an executive session, hold an executive session only at a regular or special meeting and for the sole purpose of considering the purchase, acquisition, lease, transfer or sale of any real, personal or other property interests; conferences with an attorney to receive legal advice on specific legal issues; matters required to be kept confidential by federal or state law, rules or regulations; specialized details of security arrangements or investigations; determining positions relative to matters that may be subject to negotiations, developing strategy for negotiations, and instructing negotiators; consideration of personnel matters except if the employee who is the subject of the session has requested an open meeting, or if the personnel matter involves more than one employee, and all of the employees have requested an open meeting provided, however, that this provision
shall
not apply to discussions concerning any member of the local public body, any elected official or the appointment of a
person
to fill the office of a member of the local public body or an elected official or to discussions of personnel policies that do not require the discussion of matters personal to particular employees; or consideration of any documents protected by the mandatory nondisclosure provisions of the Open Records Act. No adoption of any proposed policy, position, resolution, rule, regulation, ordinance or formal
action
shall occur at such executive session. The motion to move to executive session must also include identification of the particular matter to be discussed in as much detail as possible without compromising the purpose for which the executive session is authorized. All executive sessions shall be audio recorded provided, however, if, in the opinion of the county attorney, all or a portion of the discussion during the executive session constitutes a privileged attorney-client communication, then that portion of the executive session may not be audio recorded, at the discretion of the board of county
commissioners

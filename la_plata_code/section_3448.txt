II.
Base fee calculation
. Upon receipt of an application for a building permit, the community development department shall determine the following:
A.
The type of building use and occupancy proposed;
B.
If residential development is proposed, the number of dwelling units;
C.
If a non-residential use is proposed, the gross square footage of enclosed floor area of such non-residential development.
After making these determinations, the community development department shall determine the base impact fee by multiplying the number of dwelling units and/or the gross square footage of floor area by the applicable listing in the impact fee schedule adopted by the Board of County Commissioners, as revised thereafter pursuant to the requirements of this chapter.
III.
Additional calculation considerations.
A.
If the type of new development proposed has multiple principal uses, as opposed to secondary or accessory uses commonly associated with a principal use, each identified principal use shall be subject to a separate impact fee calculation, unless the applicant can document that the effect of the multiple uses is to reduce the number of fire and emergency service calls generated by each individual principal use.
B.
If the type of new development is a qualifying home business, as defined in the La Plata County Land Use Code, the gross square footage of floor area of the portion devoted to the non-residential development shall be calculated and this portion shall be the sole amount due for payment of the fire impact fee.
C.
All impact fee calculations shall be based upon the fee schedule adopted by county resolution and in effect at the time of building permit application.
IV.
Eligibility for credits.
Credits against the base impact fee calculated to be due from a new development pursuant to subsections I and II above, shall be made to avoid over-charging an applicant when any one or more of the following circumstances exist:
A.
A landowner or developer is already required to pay an impact fee or other similar development charge for another capital facility used to provide a similar fire, rescue, and emergency service, whether by agreement or otherwise.
B.
A landowner or developer has voluntarily contributed money or in-kind assets for such a capital facility.
V.
Equitable apportionment of credit
.  Credits shall be equitably assigned to properties for which development fees, funds or assets were provided.
VI.
Application for credits.
Applications for credits shall be made by the applicant at or before the time of building permit application on a credit application/calculation form provided by the community development department.  The application form shall be completed and shall be accompanied by appropriate documentary evidence demonstrating the eligibility of the applicant for the credit. The community development department shall verify the eligibility for, and the amount of, the credit due.  The credit shall be applied against the base impact fee; provided, however, that in no event shall the credit exceed the amount of the base impact fee otherwise calculated to be due pursuant to this section.
VII.
Calculation of credits.
In calculating the credit due to the applicant, the applicant shall provide sufficient documentation to the community development department to verify the amount of the fee paid or costs incurred by the applicant or developer for the capital facility identified in the district capital improvement plan.  The credit shall be the sum of the applicant’s expenditures for a capital improvement identified in the district capital improvement plan.

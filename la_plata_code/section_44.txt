DIVISION 2. LOSS CONTROL AND SAFETY COMMITTEE
Sec. 2-101. Corrective or Disciplinary Action
If warranted, the appropriate Department Head, Elected Official, or designee shall take appropriate action under the County corrective or disciplinary action practices to prevent the recurrence of an accident or safety violation, as identified by the Committee. All recommendations of the Committee, other than a recommendation for dismissal of the employee involved, are intended to be corrective in nature to reduce the county’s liability for accidents, damage to county property, and/or employee injuries and illnesses. There should be a reasonable relationship between the offense that occurred and the recommendation. The Committee may recommend that a disciplinary action include requiring the at-fault employee to reimburse the county’s financial losses suffered, within reason and in accordance with labor laws. Any disciplinary action recommended will be done so in accordance with the terms of county personnel policies and procedures.

Chapter 80: Enforcement and Penalties
Sec. 80-1 Applicability
This code shall be enforced in accordance with the requirements of Colorado law and as provided in this chapter. Any violation of the previous county land use code will continue to be a violation under this code and be subject to penalties and enforcement under this chapter, unless the use, development, construction, or other activity complies with the provisions of this code. Inaction or lack of enforcement on the part of the county shall not constitute a waiver of the right of enforcement. Enforcement action may occur based upon a complaint submitted by a member of the public or by a county official or employee, or on the county's own initiative.

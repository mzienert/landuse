Such methods may include, but are not limited to education, preventive measures, good stewardship, and the following integrated management techniques:
Biological management, which means the use of an organism to disrupt the growth of noxious weeds.
Chemical management, which means the use of herbicides or plant growth regulators to disrupt the growth of noxious weeds.
Cultural management, which means methodologies or management practices that favor the growth of desirable plants over noxious weeds, including maintaining an optimum fertility and plant moisture status in an area, planting at optimum density and spatial arrangement in an area, and planting species most suited to an area.
Mechanical management, which means methodologies or management practices that physically disrupt plant growth, including tilling, mowing, burning, flooding, mulching, hand-pulling, hoeing, and grazing.
Effective on: 11/27/2006

means the specific, desired result of integrated management efforts and includes:

Containment, which means maintaining an intensively managed buffer zone that separates infested regions, where suppression activities prevail, from largely uninfested regions, where eradication activities prevail.
Suppression, which means reducing the vigor of noxious weed populations within an infested region, decreasing the propensity of noxious weed species to spread to surrounding lands, and mitigating the negative effects of noxious weed populations on infested lands. Suppression efforts may employ a wide variety of integrated management techniques.
Restoration, which means the removal of noxious weed species and reestablishment of desirable plant communities on lands of significant environmental or agricultural value in order to help restore or maintain said value.
Effective on: 11/27/2006

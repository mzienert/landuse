chapter 64 long range planning tools
Sec. 64-1  Comprehensive plan
I.
Purpose of comprehensive plan.
A.
The
comprehensive plan
is intended to provide general policy guidance for decisions related to land use,
growth
and a number of related issues in the
unincorporated
area of the
county
. State law, more specifically C.R.S. § 30-28-106 requires counties to create and adopt a master plan/
comprehensive plan
.  The
comprehensive plan
is an advisory document adopted by the
planning commission
. It is a document against which certain
development
proposals should be evaluated in determining whether such proposals are in general conformance with the
county
’s goals, objectives and policies. The
comprehensive plan
is not binding unless the
board
, at its discretion, chooses to codify specific provisions into the land use code.  Nevertheless, the goals, objectives and policies contained in the
comprehensive plan
should be seriously considered when reviewing applicable
development
proposals, with the appropriate body exercising discretion in the application and balancing of the numerous goals and policies contained therein. The
comprehensive plan
also provides recommendations for possible future steps that could be taken to more fully implement the community’s vision or interests.
B.
The preparation of the
comprehensive plan
is intended to promote and protect the interest of the general public and present and future populations of the
county
. Moreover, the
comprehensive plan
establishes a framework to guide recommendations and decisions regarding future
development
, appropriate
use
of the land and its resources, needed facilities and services, protection of the environmental quality of the
county
, and a realistic strategy for realizing established visions, goals and policies.
C.
It is recognized that over time the
comprehensive plan
may need to be amended as community goals and factors affecting land use change. To ensure that the
comprehensive plan
is current with the community’s vision and the overall public interest, the
comprehensive plan
shall be reviewed, modified as appropriate, and adopted or readopted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
D.
The
comprehensive plan
and the associated
district plan
s are all intended to be adopted, interpreted, and applied in a harmonious fashion. No conflicts, direct or indirect, within such plans or between such plans, or the goals, objectives and policies therein, shall be considered to exist if there exists any reasonable interpretation that would allow all the provisions of such plans at issue to remain in effect.  If an ambiguity or conflict arises, the provisions of the
comprehensive plan
should be given more weight in consideration than a conflicting
district plan
.
II.

shall not affect the validity of previously adopted plans.
III.
Use
of comprehensive plan.
A.
​​​​​Although the board does not intend to codify the comprehensive plan, or any portion thereof, it is the intent of the board that development proposals consider advisory goals and policies contained in the comprehensive plan, and in any applicable district plans.
B.
A determination of general conformance with the comprehensive plan should be made by the decision-making body for any land use permit application in light of the facts and circumstances, evidence and considerations present in relation to that particular application. In this regard, a finding of general conformance with the comprehensive plan shall be based on a quasi-judicial weighting and balancing of various goals and policies in the comprehensive plan, district plans, and code. The decision-making body shall exercise its discretion based upon the factual considerations pertaining to the particular application.
C.
In reviewing a proposal, a wide array of community issues, goals, objectives and policies, as reflected in the comprehensive plan, may be considered or implicated. Thus, determining the proper balance to various comprehensive plan goals and polices, and the attribution of weight to such goals and policies for any particular proposal, is essential in determining if general conformity is achieved for that proposal. It is within the sound discretion of the decision-making body in this process to consider all such concerns, goals and policies in relation to the application, in its entirety, and to give each the weight it deserves based upon the circumstances presented to the decision-making body. Therefore, the decision-making body may determine the proper balance of impacts, goals and policies in ascertaining if proper conformity with such comprehensive plan, in general, is desirable or has been attained.
D.
In rendering a decision on a proposal, the decision-making body should reference relevant portions of the comprehensive plan considered. Such comprehensive plan provisions should support the basis for the decision-making body’s reasoning and decision regarding the proposal, particularly in relation to a determination on general conformity with the comprehensive plan.

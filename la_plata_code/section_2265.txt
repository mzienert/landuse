Sec. 50-34 Authorizing Administrative Denials
I.
When proper evidence is submitted at a hearing of the Independent Referees that a taxpayer or its duly authorized agent has requested an “administrative denial” of its property tax appeal or petition for abatement or refund of taxes, the Independent Referees may submit findings and recommendations to the Board or Board of Equalization, as appropriate, recommending that an “administrative denial” be granted.  In such cases, the Independent Referees shall not be required to hear any additional testimony, take any additional evidence, or make any additional findings or recommendations about the matter before them.
II.
Absent good cause, in such matters, the Board shall adopt the recommendations of the Independent Referees, and shall grant such requests for “administrative denial.”

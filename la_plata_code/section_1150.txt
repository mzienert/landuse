I.
The
flood
hazard areas of the
county
are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
II.
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood-proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.

The duties and responsibilities of the
floodplain administrator
shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:
Review, approve, or deny all applications for
floodplain development permits
required by adoption of this chapter.
Review floodplain development permit applications to determine whether a proposed
building
site
, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding.
Review
permits
for proposed
development
to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control
Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required.
Inspect all development at appropriate times during the period of
construction
to ensure compliance with all provisions of this chapter, including proper elevation of the
structure
.
Interpretation of
floodplain
boundaries.
Where interpretation is needed as to the accurate location of the boundaries the
special flood hazard area
(for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretations.
If available, the
base flood elevation
as shown on the profiles and tabulations for the points in question shall be the governing factor in determining accurate boundaries and shall take precedence over the boundaries shown on the maps.
When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with subsection (V)(B) of this section, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, as criteria for requiring that
new construction
,
substantial improvements
or other development are administered in accordance with division 3 of this chapter.
Any
person
contesting the location of a floodplain boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the floodplain designation. Any boundary appeal must be substantiated by technical engineering data of sufficient detail to allow a determination to be made. The planning and building
departments
shall review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, both departments shall ensure that the encroachment provisions of division 3 of this chapter are met.
Information to be obtained and maintained. The floodplain administrator shall:
Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.
Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to
mean sea level
) of the
lowest floor
(including the
basement
) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement.
For all new or substantially improved
flood
proofed structures:
Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level to which the structure has been flood proofed); and
Maintain the
flood proofing
certifications required in this chapter.
Notification. Notify adjacent
communities
and the state water conservation
board
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to
FEMA
.
Maintenance. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

Effective on: 8/5/2014
Sec. 78-53. Application approval or denial.
Approval or denial of a
floodplain development permit
by the
floodplain administrator
shall
be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors:
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
The susceptibility of the proposed
facility
and its contents to
flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner
;
The danger that materials
may
be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The compatibility of the proposed
use
with existing and anticipated
development
;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency
vehicles
;
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave
action
, if applicable, expected at the
site
;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
The relationship of the proposed use to any comprehensive plan, master plan or
floodplain management
program for that area, if applicable.
For waterways with
base flood elevations
for which a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no
new construction
,
substantial improvements
, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the
county
FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and reasonably anticipated development, will not increase the
water surface elevation
of the
base flood
more than one-half foot at any point within the county.
Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, as amended, the floodplain administrator may approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the county's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one-half foot, provided that the
applicant
first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through
FEMA
(conditional letter of map revision), fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of 44 CFR § 65.12 and receives FEMA approval.

Sec. 78-54. Variance procedure.
Appeals
board
.
A
board of appeals
consisting of the board of
county
commissioners
is hereby established to hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances
from the requirements of this chapter.
The board of appeals
shall
hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the
floodplain administrator
in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
Those aggrieved by the decision of the board of appeals
may
seek judicial review of such decision pursuant to C.R.C.P. 106(a)(4).
In passing upon such applications, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this chapter, including but not limited to section
78-53.
Upon consideration of the factors of this article and the purposes of this chapter, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this chapter.
Conditions for variances.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures
upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure
's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, with regard to the procedures set forth in this section.
A variance shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood
levels during the
base flood
discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant
; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or regulations.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure may be permitted to be built with a
lowest floor
elevation below the
base flood elevation
and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
Generally, variances may be issued for
new construction
and
substantial improvements
to be erected on a
lot
of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the provisions of section 78-53 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justifications required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued by the floodplain administrator for new construction and substantial improvements and for other
development
necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use
provided that:
The criteria outlined in this section are met, and
The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
Record of variances. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all
actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to
FEMA
upon request.

Sec. 78-75. Areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones).
Located within the
special flood hazard areas
established in this chapter are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special
flood
hazards associated with
base flood
depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined
channel
does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow
may
be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
All
new construction
and
substantial improvements
of
residential
structures
have the
lowest floor
(including
basement
), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment
and other service
facilities
(including ductwork), elevated above the
highest adjacent grade
at least one foot above the depth number specified in feet on the applicable FIRM (at least three feet if no depth number is specified). Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement,
shall
be certified by a registered Colorado
Professional Engineer
, architect, or land surveyor. Such certification shall be submitted to the
floodplain administrator
.
All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures (with the exception of
critical facilities
as outlined in section 78-79);
Have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one foot above the depth number specified in feet on the applicable FIRM (at least three feet if no depth number is specified); or
Together with attendant
utility
and sanitary facilities be designed so that the structure is watertight to at least one foot above the base flood level with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.
A Colorado registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this chapter are satisfied.
Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.

Sec. 78-76. Floodways.
Located within areas of special
flood
hazard are areas designated as "floodways." Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
All encroachments within floodways including fill,
new construction
,
substantial improvements
and other
development
are prohibited, unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a licensed Colorado
Professional Engineer
and in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase (requires a
no-rise certification
) in flood levels within the
community
during the occurrence of the
base flood
discharge.
If the general standards of section 78-72 are satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

Effective on: 8/5/2014
Sec. 78-77. Alteration of a watercourse.
For all proposed
developments
that alter a watercourse within a
special flood hazard area
, the following standards
shall
apply:
Channelization
and flow diversion
projects
shall appropriately consider issues of sediment transport, erosion, deposition, and
channel
migration and properly mitigate potential problems through the project as well as upstream and downstream of any
improvement
activity. A detailed analysis of sediment transport and overall channel stability should be considered, when appropriate, to assist in determining the most appropriate design.
Channelization and flow diversion projects shall evaluate the residual
100-year floodplain
.
Any channelization or other stream alteration activity proposed by a project proponent must be evaluated for its impact on the regulatory
floodplain
and be in compliance with all applicable Federal, State and local floodplain rules, regulations and ordinances.
Any stream alteration activity shall be designed and sealed by a registered Colorado
professional engineer
or certified professional hydrologist.
All activities within the regulatory floodplain shall meet all applicable federal, state and
county
floodplain requirements and regulations.
Within the regulatory floodway, stream alteration activities shall not be constructed unless the project proponent demonstrates through a floodway analysis and report, sealed by a registered Colorado professional engineer, that there is not more than a 0.00-foot rise in the proposed conditions compared to existing conditions floodway resulting from the project, otherwise known as a
no-rise certification
, unless the project proponent first obtains a CLOMR and floodway revision in accordance with section 78-76 of this article.
Maintenance shall be required for any altered or relocated portions of watercourses so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

Effective on: 8/5/2014
Sec. 78-78. Properties removed from the floodplain by fill.
A
floodplain development permit
shall
not be issued for the
construction
of a new
structure
or
addition
to an existing structure on a property removed from the
floodplain
by the issuance of a
FEMA
letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F)
, unless such new structure or addition complies with the following:
For all
new construction
and
substantial improvements
of
residential
structures, the
lowest floor
(including
basement
), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment
and other service
facilities
(including ductwork), must be elevated to at least one foot above the
base flood elevation
that existed prior to the placement of fill.
For all new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures, the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), must be elevated to at least one foot above the base flood elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill, or together with attendant
utility
and sanitary facilities be designed so that the structure or addition is watertight to at least one foot above the
base flood
level that existed prior to the placement of fill with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of the effects of buoyancy.

Effective on: 8/5/2014
Sec. 78-79. Standards for critical facilities.
I.
Classification of critical facilities. It is the responsibility of the
board of county commissioners
to identify and confirm that specific structures in their community meet the following criteria:
Critical facilities are classified under the following categories: (i) essential services; (ii) hazardous materials; (iii) at-risk populations; and (iv) vital to restoring normal services.
A.
Essential services
facilities
include public safety,
emergency
response, emergency medical, designated emergency shelters, communications, public
utility
plant facilities, and transportation lifelines. These facilities consist of:
1.
Public safety (police stations, fire and rescue stations, emergency
vehicle
and
equipment
storage, and, emergency operation centers);
2.
Emergency medical (hospitals, ambulance service centers, urgent care centers having emergency treatment functions, and non-ambulatory surgical structures but excluding clinics, doctors offices, and non-urgent care medical structures that do not provide these functions);
3.
Designated emergency shelters;
4.
Communications (main hubs for telephone, broadcasting equipment for cable systems, satellite dish systems, cellular systems, television, radio, and other emergency warning systems, but excluding towers, poles, lines, cables, and conduits);
5.
Public utility plant facilities for generation and distribution (hubs, treatment plants, substations and pumping stations for water, power and gas, but not including towers, poles, power lines, buried pipelines,
transmission lines
,
distribution lines
, and
service lines
); and
6.
Air transportation lifelines (airports (municipal and larger), helicopter pads and structures serving emergency functions, and associated infrastructure (aviation
control
towers, air traffic control centers, and emergency equipment aircraft hangars)).
Specific exemptions to this category include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), non-potable water treatment and distribution systems, and hydroelectric power generating plants and related appurtenances.
Public utility plant facilities may be exempted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board of county commissioners that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it
shall
be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same utility or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract) and connected, the alternative facilities are either located outside of the
100-year floodplain
or are compliant with the provisions of this article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant systems will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the board of county commissioners on an as-needed basis upon request.
B.
Hazardous materials facilities include facilities that produce or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials. These facilities may include:
1.
Chemical and pharmaceutical plants (chemical plant, pharmaceutical manufacturing);
2.
Laboratories containing highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials;
3.
Refineries;
4.
Hazardous waste storage and disposal
sites
; and
5.
Above ground gasoline or propane storage or sales centers.
Facilities shall be determined to be critical facilities if they produce or store materials in excess of threshold limits. If the
owner
of a facility is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to keep a
material safety data sheet (MSDS)
on file for any chemicals stored or used in the work place, and the
chemical(s)
is stored in quantities equal to or greater than the
threshold planning quantity (TPQ)
for that chemical, then that facility shall be considered to be a critical facility. The TPQ for these chemicals is: either 500 pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever is lower) for the  chemicals listed under 40 C.F.R. § 302, also known as extremely hazardous substances (EHS); or 10,000 pounds for any other chemical. This threshold is consistent with the requirements for reportable chemicals established by the Colorado
Department
of Public Health and Environment. OSHA requirements for MSDS can be found in 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1200. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation "Designation, Reportable Quantities, and Notification," 40 C.F.R. § 30 and OSHA regulation "Occupational Safety and Health Standards," 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1200 are incorporated herein by reference and include the regulations in existence at the time of the promulgation of this article, but exclude later amendments to or editions of the regulations.
Specific exemptions to this category include:
1.
Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing hazardous materials intended for household
use
, and
agricultural
products intended for agricultural use.
2.
Buildings
and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local authority having
jurisdiction
by hazard assessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the local jurisdiction having land use authority) that a release of the subject hazardous material does not pose a major threat to the public.
3.
Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage, and distribution centers that do not manufacture pharmaceutical products.
These exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as critical facilities under another category outlined in this chapter.
C.
At-risk population facilities include medical care, congregate care, and schools. These facilities consist of:
1.
Elder care (nursing homes);
2.
Congregate care serving 12 or more individuals (
day care
and assisted living); and
3.
Public and private schools (pre-schools, K-12 schools), before-school and after-school care serving 12 or more children).
D.
Facilities vital to restoring normal services including government operations. These facilities consist of:
1.
Essential government operations (public records, courts, jails, building permitting and inspection services, community administration and
management
, maintenance and equipment centers); and,
2.
Essential structures for public colleges and universities (dormitories, offices, and classrooms only).
These facilities may be exempted if it is demonstrated to the board of county commissioners that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same entity or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract), the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with this article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant facilities will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the board of county commissioners on an as-needed basis upon request.
II.
Protection for critical facilities. All new and substantially improved critical facilities and new
additions
to critical facilities located within the
special flood hazard area
shall be regulated to a higher standard than structures not determined to be critical facilities. For the purposes of this article, protection shall include one of the following:
A.
Location outside the special flood hazard area; or
B.
Elevation of the
lowest floor
or
flood proofing
of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to at least two feet above the
base flood elevation
.
III.
Ingress and egress for new critical facilities. New critical facilities shall, when practicable as determined by the board of county commissioners, have continuous non-inundated access (ingress and egress for evacuation and emergency services) during a100-year flood event.

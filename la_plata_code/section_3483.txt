Other inspections and fees:
Any other service which is provided outside of the normal course of business/outside of the normal course of county activity may be charged back to the requesting party at the rate of actual cost (which may include an overtime premium for labor hours) plus an additional charge (not to exceed ten percent) for overhead and other fixed costs.
County employees will be reimbursed for the use of their personal vehicles for official, documented county business at the allowable rate published by the Internal Revenue Service in publication number 535. Such documentation shall include the date, location, mileage and purpose of the business travel.
The allowable rate published by the Internal Revenue Services in publication number 535 shall also be used by county offices, such as the sheriff's office, when assessing mileage fees in the performance of official duties.
Fees for credit card payment and online payment convenience fees:
In certain circumstances, the county may accept credit cards for payment of fees, licenses, permits, penalties and other charges. In those cases, the credit card processor may charge the user a convenience fee or other charge for processing the credit card transaction or payment by e-check.
The county may also charge a fee for processing credit card transactions, with the fee not to exceed the county's actual cost.
The credit card fee(s) or e-check fee(s) shall be clearly defined and presented to the user prior to utilizing the credit card or e-check, and the user shall have the opportunity to make alternate and acceptable tender if they do not wish to pay the convenience fee. In certain situations (for example, during non-business hours) the county may be only able to accept credit card or e-check transactions and the consumer must pay the fee or wait until an alternate and acceptable tender agreement can be made.

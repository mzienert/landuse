Overview
This chapter describes the common procedures for
county
review of all land development activity in the
unincorporated

development
approval, expiration, and amendments.
The specific procedural steps for divisions of land are in chapter 67 and for
planned unit developments
in chapter 68.
Sec. 66-11 Submission and review of development application
I.
Submission of development application.
A.
Authority to file applications.
1.
Applications in general.  Applications for development shall be submitted by the owner, any other person having a recognized interest in the real property for which the development is proposed, or their authorized agent.  If the applicant is not the owner, or is a contract purchaser of the real property, the applicant shall submit an authorization form signed by the owner consenting to the submission of the application.  If the applicant is not the sole owner of the real property, the applicant shall submit an authorization form signed by the other owners or an association representing the owners consenting to or joining in the application.
2.
Applications modifying existing plats.  For proposed applications to be processed pursuant to subsection 67-11.1 that modify existing recorded plats or otherwise seek to change any aspect of a plat signed by the chair of the board, the applicant shall include documentation demonstrating consent of owners who represent at least sixty-seven (67) percent of the combined total of number of lots identified on the existing plat. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in all circumstances the director may exercise the discretion to require the consent of one or more owners of adjacent properties that are impacted, or could be impacted, by the proposed development.
B.
Submit to CDD by appointment.  All applications required by this code shall be submitted to the CDD by making an appointment with staff, unless otherwise specified by the director.
C.
Contact person (agent) designation required.  The applicant shall designate one (1) person on the application as the primary contact person who will be responsible on behalf of the applicant for all notifications, including meeting dates, deadlines, and requirements.  The county will communicate with the contact person.  It is the contact person's responsibility to inform the owners or applicant of all information conveyed by the county or any referral agency. The applicant shall notify the director in writing if there is a change in the contact person.
D.
Application contents.
1.
Submittal requirements. The director is authorized to establish submittal requirements for all applications required by this code.  Applications shall contain all information needed to determine the development's compliance with the standards and approval criteria adopted in this code.  If any part of the submittal requirements is missing, the application will be deemed incomplete and the application will not be accepted. The director shall provide all the required forms necessary to implement such requirements as follows:
a.
The director shall create and periodically revise, as necessary, forms for each type of application required by this code.
b.
Application forms shall include the specific information required to process each type of application. The specific information requirements shall be established and periodically revised by the director with the purpose of facilitating the evaluation of applications for compliance with the standards of this code and the efficient administration of this code.
c.
The director is authorized to establish a standardized format for each type of required submittal, and to allow deviations from the format in instances where the director finds that an alternative format would provide for a review that is more efficient.
2.
Professional certification.  The director has discretion to require an engineer’s stamp or other professional certification of any documents or materials submitted pursuant to this code.
E.
Fees.
1.
All application submittals shall include the application fee in the amount indicated on the county’s fee schedule, as well as any review fees charged by the reviewing county surveyor, school districts, and other referral agencies for which the county has agreed to collect.
2.
County clerk and recorder's office fees shall be paid to the county by the applicant at the time of recording.
3.
Referral agency fees. Other outside referral agencies may require review fees and the applicant shall pay those fees directly to the referral agencies in advance of their review and comment.
F.
Applicant responsible for reimbursing county for consultant review fees.
1.
Consultant review authorized. The director is authorized to retain professional consultants at the applicant's expense to assist in the review of proposed development. The director may make an initial determination as to the use of consultants at the time of the pre-application meeting and may revise the determination if new or changed information in the application materials justifies the revision.  The selection of the consultant shall be within the sole discretion of the director.
2.
Payment of consultant review fee. If, at any point in the review process, the director determines an application will require review by professional consultants the applicant shall be responsible for all costs associated with the consultants’ review or support services.  Such consultants or support services may include, but are not limited to: fees or costs for technical consultants, expert witnesses, engineers, attorneys, court reporters, or transcription fees. The director shall provide the applicant with a written preliminary estimate of anticipated services or professional consultant review or service fees, whether fixed or at an hourly rate.   Not later than twenty (20) days following receipt of the director’s estimate, the applicant shall present to the director certified funds in the amount set, whether as payment in whole or as a deposit. Generally, the amount set shall be one hundred (100) percent of the estimated service or review fees.  Regardless of such estimate, the applicant shall be responsible for all service or consultant review fees.  As review of the application progresses, if necessary, the applicant shall replenish the fee account to ensure that funds are available to continue to meet the costs of county review or services related to the decision-making process, including costs incurred by the county during any appeal process.  Until the fee is paid or replenished as necessary, the application shall not be further processed. Unused funds for professional services or consultant review shall be returned to the applicant no later than sixty (60) days after the decision-making body’s final action or, if applicable, the exhaustion of all judicial remedies.
3.
Payment to reimburse county for additional costs. The director may require the payment of additional funds to reimburse the county for services related to the application, should they become necessary.  If a balance becomes due, the application shall be considered incomplete until such time as the payment is received from the applicant. The review body and decision-making body shall take no formal action on the application until all fees and expenses incurred to date have been paid.
4.
Fixed-fee consultant review. The director is authorized to establish:
a.
A roster of consultants that are pre-qualified to conduct reviews of various types;
b.
A schedule of fixed fees.
G.
Concurrent review.  At the election of the applicant, and with the director’s approval, different types of applications may be consolidated or processed concurrently whenever possible to expedite total review and processing time for a project.  The time frame and approval process for consolidated or concurrently reviewed applications shall follow the longest time frame and approval process required for the subject application types.  In no event shall two (2) mutually exclusive applications be processed concurrently.  The submission of multiple applications for the same property is a good faith representation that the applicant intends to pursue both projects, if approved.
II.
Community development department review and referral.
A.
Determination application is complete and sufficient to accept for processing.
1.
Complete application sufficient for processing.  An application shall be considered complete if it is determined to be sufficient for processing and is accompanied by the applicable processing fee.  An application is sufficient for processing if staff determines it is submitted in the required form and includes all submittal information including all items identified by the director on the county’s pre-application checklist.  Staff shall perform a pre-submittal review of a proposed application submittal to determine its sufficiency to accept for processing.  The pre-submittal review shall not exceed five (5) business days without the applicant’s consent. Upon a determination that an application is sufficient for processing, the applicant shall pay the applicable processing fee(s) to complete the application and to initiate the review of the submittal.
2.
Incomplete application insufficient for processing.  If an application is insufficient for processing the application shall be deemed incomplete and written notice shall be provided to the applicant specifying the application’s deficiencies.  No further action shall be taken on the application until the deficiencies are remedied.  If the applicant fails to correct the deficiencies within sixty (60) days of the notice of deficiencies and has not communicated a reason for just cause for delay to the director, the application shall be considered withdrawn.
B.
Referral to agencies.
1.
Referral to appropriate agencies.  The county does not provide services such as fire protection, water supply and sanitary sewage treatment, health inspections or schools.  Development proposals can impact the agencies providing these services and the county relies on these agencies to identify development requirements and provide comments through the referral process.  Upon acceptance of an application, the director shall distribute pertinent materials from the application to the appropriate agencies as dictated by specific provisions in this code or by the director when determined to be necessary to ensure that the proposal complies with all applicable standards and requirements.  Referral agencies include the following:
a.
Other county departments;
b.
Reviewing county surveyor;
c.
County, state, and federal agencies;
d.
Special districts;
e.
Fire districts;
f.
Ditch owners;
g.
Homeowners’ or property owners’ associations;
h.
Water conservancy districts;
i.
Open space conservancy districts;
j.
Airports;
k.
Municipalities pursuant to sub-subparagraph 66-11.II.B.2.a. below;
l.
Tribal governments pursuant to sub-subparagraph 66-11.II.B.2.b. below;
m.
Providers of utilities;
n.
Any other agency, organization or person who, in the opinion of the director, may be affected or can expertly contribute to the review of the proposed development.
2.
Applications to be sent to governing bodies of municipalities and tribal governments.
a.
Applicable materials from applications of proposed developments located within two (2) miles of municipal boundaries or within a municipality's designated service area shall be sent to the governing body of the municipality.  If the project is located within three (3) miles of a municipality that has a formal annexation plan for that area, the municipality shall be sent applicable materials from the application.
b.
Tribal governments shall be notified of any development proposed within their exterior reservation boundary. In addition, as required by state law and any applicant intergovernmental agreement, the director shall notify and consult with both the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe regarding any proposal of a "facility" as defined by C.R.S. § 29-20-403(10), that is proposed for location within the "Brunot Area" as defined by C.R.S. § 29-20-403(2).

3.
At a minimum, preliminary plats and conceptual development plans shall be submitted to those agencies specified in C.R.S. § 30-28-136.
4.
The applicant shall be responsible for submitting any additional information required by the referral agencies, copies of the application to enable agency review, and for covering reasonable costs, such as postage and scheduled review fees, associated with distribution of the application materials to referral agencies.
5.
Time frame for review. Referral agencies and departments shall submit their comments to the director within twenty-one (21) days of the agency’s receipt of the referral packet. If no comments are received, the referral agency, organization, or individual shall be deemed to have waived the right to submit comment unless such comments are otherwise needed to demonstrate compliance with a requirement of this code or state statute. Staff may grant a necessary extension of up to thirty (30) additional days for an agency’s review and comments, with the applicant’s consent. Staff will reasonably attempt to incorporate late comments into the staff report.
6.
Additional review. During the review of an application, the director may require that the applicant solicit additional comments regarding a project from the appropriate agencies if the director determines that the applicant did not adequately address an agency’s original comment or if the application is revised.
7.
Alternative agency comment procedures. For director determinations, administrative land use permits and other types of administrative applications, the director may establish alternative procedures for the applicant to obtain agency comments, signatures or certifications in order to expedite the review of the application.
8.
The applicant shall respond to and remedy all concerns, deficiencies and recommendations necessary to comply with the requirements of this code set forth in the referral responses received and shall submit such responses to the CDD. If the applicant fails to submit a thorough response within sixty (60) days and has not communicated just cause for delay to the director, then the application shall be considered withdrawn by the applicant.
C.
Compliance review of application.
1.
Staff shall review the application for compliance with all applicable approval criteria and use, density, and development standards contained in this code and other applicable law.  Within fifteen (15) business days of the end of the time frame for agency review, staff shall conclude the compliance review of the application and notify the applicant of the results in writing.  The time frame for review may be extended by staff pursuant to paragraph 66-12.III.B. An application shall be considered compliant if the information contained in the application demonstrates that the proposed development is ripe for consideration of compliance with this code’s requirement.  Any and all approvals for variances or waivers to required standards except those reviewed by the board shall be obtained prior to the processing of any project to the PC or board.  If after an application has been submitted, the director determines that a variance or waiver is necessary, the application shall be held in abeyance until such variance or waiver is approved.
2.
If staff’s compliance review identifies areas where the application does not demonstrate that the proposed development complies with this code’s requirements and is determined to be non-compliant, staff’s notification to the applicant shall specifically identify those items and associated code provisions. The applicant shall have an opportunity to revise the application materials.  Revisions, additions and corrections to application materials in response to staff’s compliance review shall be re-submitted within a time frame specified by staff.  The time frame specified by staff shall not be less than thirty (30) days, and the re-submittal shall be subject to the application submission, agency referral and staff review provisions of this code section.
III.
Inactive
application
.
A.
Inactive applications. An application will be considered inactive if at any point in a development review process any of the following occur:
1.
The director or a referral agency has notified the applicant that additional or corrected materials are required, and the applicant has not submitted such materials within a specified time frame or when no time frame was specified, sixty (60) days after the date of such notification;
2.
The applicant fails to attend any scheduled neighborhood meeting, meeting with the director, or meeting before the PC, board, or BOA;
3.
The director determines that substantial evidence exists that the application is inactive, including but not limited to other actions or inaction by applicant.
B.
No further processing of such inactive application shall occur until the deficiencies are determined by the director to be rectified. If the applicant does not rectify the deficiencies within a sixty (60) day period immediately following the date of the occurrences outlined in subparagraphs 66-11.III.A.1 through 3, the application shall be considered automatically withdrawn.  Prior to the date on which the application is deemed withdrawn, the director may extend the specified time frame should the director determine that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant prevent timely completion of the application.
C.
Re-submittal of automatically withdrawn application.  Any re-submittal of an automatically withdrawn application requires a new application, beginning with the pre-application process.
IV.
Neighborhood meetings.
A.
Purpose.  The county encourages and may require informal neighborhood meetings between applicants and potentially affected landowners and residents to facilitate public input to land use decisions early in the review process.  A neighborhood meeting is not a public hearing.
B.
Applicability.  Neighborhood meetings may be required by the director for the types of applications as specified in Table 66-15.
C.
Neighborhood meeting procedures.
1.
The neighborhood meeting shall be held after staff’s receipt of department and agency comments on a land use permit or development application, but prior to the first public meeting for the proposed project.
2.
During the review of the application, the director may require a neighborhood meeting if it is determined that the application may have adverse impacts on the neighborhood or where neighbors have raised objections based on compliance with this code.
3.
The director shall mail notice of the neighborhood meeting to surrounding landowners pursuant to section 66-14 prior to the meeting.
4.
The staff shall prepare an agenda and chair the meeting. The applicant shall attend the neighborhood meeting and explain the proposed project. The applicant shall present what methods are planned to make the use compatible with surrounding uses. Following the applicant's presentation, the neighbors may comment on the proposed project or question the applicant on issues presented and the impacts of the use on the neighborhood.
Discussion between the applicant and neighbors to resolve questions and concerns is encouraged.
5.
Staff shall prepare a report summarizing the discussion points from the neighborhood meeting which shall be included with the staff report for any subsequent public meetings.
6.
An applicant's failure to attend any required neighborhood meetings may delay review of the application or result in an inactive application under subsection 66-11.III.
7.
If no surrounding landowner attends the neighborhood meeting for which proper notice was given, the applicant shall have satisfied the requirements for that neighborhood meeting.
V.
Staff report and recommendation.
A.
Preparation of staff report and recommendation. Unless the application is one that is approved by a director determination letter, following the compliance review of the application, including the period for the applicant's response to any noncompliance matters, staff shall prepare a written staff report.  The report shall include discussion of the relevant issues pertaining to the compliance of the application with the standards and approval criteria of this code.  The staff report shall incorporate public comments, the relevant comments from referral agencies and any other relevant information concerning the application.  The staff report shall conclude with a recommendation for application approval, approval with conditions, or denial. Conditions for approval may be recommended to eliminate any areas of noncompliance, ensure compatibility or to mitigate any adverse impacts from the development proposal.
B.
Consent agenda placement. If an application meets or exceeds all required standards and procedures or will meet all requirements with staff recommended conditions, and the director recommends approval or approval with any such conditions, the director may place the application on the PC’s or board’s consent agenda.  At the public meeting, the PC or board may approve such consent agenda with a single motion, or a member may move to place consideration of the project on the decision agenda for project specific review.  Any member of the public, applicant, or staff may also request project specific review and, subject to an affirmative vote of the decision-making body, the project may be moved to the decision agenda for project specific review and consideration.  If an application fails to meet or exceed all required standards, requirements, and procedures and the director recommends denial, the director shall place the application on the PC’s or board’s decision agenda.
C.
Distribution of staff report.  Staff shall distribute the staff report to the applicant, review or decision-making body, and county attorney and shall also make the staff report available to any interested parties and members of the public prior to the scheduled meeting date.

Chapter 72: Overlay Areas and Supplemental Overlay Standards
Sec. 72-1 Purpose and applicability
This code establishes and provides for certain overlay areas. Overlay areas are designated to protect areas with special needs and characteristics, such as airports or may, among other things, be used to encourage newer forms of development around the perimeter of municipal boundaries. These overlay areas may have either independent or supplemental standards on land use and development within the area designated. Unless otherwise specified, the standards set forth in this chapter 72 shall apply to all land use development located within certain geographical areas identified by the applicable overlay area. The standards in this chapter 72 shall apply in addition to the basic standards set forth in chapter 70 and, depending upon the nature of the use, the standards set forth in chapter 73. Chapter 74 shall not apply to the joint planning area described in section 72-2 but shall apply to other overlay areas addressed in this chapter.

Chapter 70: General Site Development Standards Applicable to All Development
Sec. 70-11 Road access and driveway permits
I.
Access
. Legal access to public roads shall be provided to all lots and parcels via public or private right-of-way or perpetual access easements. Access onto state highways is under the jurisdiction of the state division of highways. An access permit may be required by the state for any new accesses, change of existing access, or change of use of a property. Access shall be according to state requirements and specifications. Unless exempt, all driveways shall require a county driveway permit and shall meet road and bridge standards within chapter 74.
II.
Road improvements and service levels.
New developments shall be required to construct improvements to existing roads on-site and off-site in accordance with their projected impact on those roads. This may include adding travel lanes, turn lanes, larger bridges or improvements to the road surface in order to mitigate the impacts of a development in both the construction and completed stages. Development is prohibited unless the road providing access meets, or will be improved to meet, the applicable standards as detailed in chapter 74.
III.
Pedestrian circulation
. Developments are required to provide internal pedestrian circulation facilities. Where improved sidewalks or walkways exist adjacent to a project, and along the right-of-way, the project shall connect with sidewalks or walkways of equal or greater quality. Such facilities shall extend along property frontage for the entire distance of a lot or parcel which is the site of the project.

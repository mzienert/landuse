Sec. 78-54. Variance procedure.
Appeals
board
.
A
board of appeals
consisting of the board of
county
commissioners
is hereby established to hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances
from the requirements of this chapter.
The board of appeals
shall
hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the
floodplain administrator
in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
Those aggrieved by the decision of the board of appeals
may
seek judicial review of such decision pursuant to C.R.C.P. 106(a)(4).
In passing upon such applications, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this chapter, including but not limited to section
78-53.
Upon consideration of the factors of this article and the purposes of this chapter, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this chapter.
Conditions for variances.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures
upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure
's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, with regard to the procedures set forth in this section.
A variance shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood
levels during the
base flood
discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant
; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or regulations.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure may be permitted to be built with a
lowest floor
elevation below the
base flood elevation
and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
Generally, variances may be issued for
new construction
and
substantial improvements
to be erected on a
lot
of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the provisions of section 78-53 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justifications required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued by the floodplain administrator for new construction and substantial improvements and for other
development
necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use
provided that:
The criteria outlined in this section are met, and
The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
Record of variances. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all
actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to
FEMA
upon request.

shall
constitute a class 2 misdemeanor traffic offense, and upon conviction, such violator shall be punished by a minimum mandatory fine of not less than $200.00, nor more than $300.00, or up to 90 days imprisonment, or both such fine or imprisonment. Each

trip shall constitute a separate offense. For purposes of this section, a vehicle trip means a one-way transit, in any manner, from any point to any point on
county roads
.
Whenever the driver of any vehicle in violation of any provision of this article is not the
owner
but is operating such vehicle with the express or implied consent of the owner, then such owner shall also be deemed to be in violation of this article. Conviction of either the driver or owner shall not bar conviction of the other.
Liability for damages:
No
person
shall drive, operate or move upon or over any
county
road, highway or bridge any vehicle, object or contrivance in such manner so as to cause damage to such road, highway or bridge. When the damage sustained to such road, highway or bridge is the result of the operating, driving or moving of such vehicle, object or contrivance weighing in excess of the maximum weight authorized by division 4 of this article, or by the appendices to Ordinance No. 1997-1, it shall be no defense to any
action
, either civil or criminal, brought against such person that the weight of the vehicle was authorized by
permit
.
Every person violating the provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall be liable for all damages which such road, highway or bridge
may
sustain as a result thereof. Whenever the driver of such vehicle, object or contrivance is not the owner thereof, but is operating, driving or moving such vehicle, object or contrivance with the express or implied consent of the owner thereof, then such owner or driver shall be jointly and severally liable for any such damage. The liability for damage sustained by any such road, highway or bridge may be enforced by a civil action as provided in C.R.S. § 42-4-512. No satisfaction of such civil liability, however, shall be deemed to be a release or satisfaction of any criminal liability for the violation of the provisions of this article.

Sec. 42-357. Vehicles weighed; excess removed.
Any law enforcement officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle
and load is unlawful is authorized to require the driver to
stop
and submit to a weighing of the vehicle by means of either portable or stationary scales or
shall
require that such vehicle be driven to the nearest public scales in the event such scales are within five miles.
Except as provided in this subsection, whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load as provided in subsection (I) of this section, determines that the weight is unlawful, such officer shall require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as
may
be necessary to reduce the gross weight of such vehicle to such limit as permitted under this article. All material so unloaded shall be cared for by the
owner or operator
of such vehicle at the risk of such owner or operator. Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load as provided in subsection (I) of this section, determines that the weight is unlawful and the load consists solely of either explosives or hazardous materials as defined in C.R.S. § 42-1-102(32), such officer shall
permit
the driver of such vehicle to proceed to his destination without requiring him to unload the excess portion of such load.
It is unlawful for any driver of a vehicle to fail or refuse to stop and submit the vehicle and load to a weighing or to fail or refuse when directed by an officer upon a weighing of the vehicle to stop the vehicle and otherwise comply with the provisions of this section.

I.
P
urpose and Scope.
Unincorporated areas of the county have been identified as possessing a significant risk of wildland fires and many of these areas are along the wildland-urban interface where there is an increased risk of wildfires spreading from wildland vegetation to developed areas. Catastrophic wildfires take a large economic toll on the community through property losses, decreased tourism, suppression costs and increased insurance premiums. Furthermore, wildland fires pose a risk to human life, particularly where existing residential communities are located within heavily wooded areas and have limited ingress/egress roadways, or inadequate roadways to accommodate safe and effective evacuations. Fire restrictions help agencies and the community reduce fire risk and prevent fires during periods of high or extreme fire danger.

III.
Roles and responsibilities.
A.
Sheriff as fire warden.  The sheriff is the fire warden for the county and the individual ultimately responsible for controlling and extinguishing wildfires in the unincorporated area of the county and wildfires occurring within a fire district that exceed the capabilities of a fire protection district.  C.R.S. § 29-22-103(2)(a).  The sheriff is also responsible for preserving the peace within the county.  C.R.S. § 30-10-516.
B.
Board of County Commissioners.  The Board of County Commissioners cooperates with other counties and with the state forester in the organization and training of rural fire fighting groups, payment for the operation and maintenance of firefighting equipment and in sharing the cost of suppressing fires.  C.R.S. § 30-11-107(1)(o).  The board may also adopt an ordinance banning open fires within those portions of the unincorporated areas of the county where the danger of wildfire is high.  C.R.S. § 30-15-401(1)(n.5).
C.
Fire department/fire protection district.  The chief of a fire department in each fire protection district in the county is responsible for the management of wildland fires that occur within the district and that are within the capability of the district to control or extinguish.  C.R.S. § 29-22.5-103(1)(a).
IV.
Banned devices.
The use or release of a sky lantern into the airspace of La Plata County is prohibited.
V.
Declaration of fire restrictions.
The board, the sheriff or the sheriff’s designee, upon competent evidence of high fire danger, is authorized to declare by resolution, fire restrictions or the rescission of fire restrictions, in all or portions of the unincorporated areas of the county.  Such fire restrictions shall pertain to any activity that produces or maintains, or attempts to produce or maintain, a spark, flame or any known ignition sources for open fires and may include a prohibition on the use and sale of fireworks. Adoption of a resolution shall occur after consultation with and upon the recommendation of the local fire chiefs and the fire management officers of local federal agencies.  The recommendations of such agencies shall be based upon the criteria for adopting or downgrading fire restrictions or closures set forth in the operating plan.  Resolutions imposing fire restrictions shall include an express finding that fire danger is high and the parameters of the fire restrictions are deemed necessary and appropriate.
VI.
Automatic fire restrictions.
The board finds that red flag warnings, as designated by the National Weather Service, are competent evidence that fire danger is high and that wildland fires may quickly spread out of control.  Subject to the exemptions set forth in section 43-1(VII) and provided neither stage 2 nor stage 3 restrictions are already in place, during such times of high fire danger and for the duration of the red flag warning, the stage 1 restrictions set forth in the operating plan, shall automatically apply without further action by the board or the sheriff.
VII.

2.
The use of an open fire or equipment necessary for the emergency repair of public utilities.
3.
Fires permitted by the sheriff or, with prior notice to and consent of the sheriff, a local fire chief operating within such fire chief’s jurisdiction, if, in such fire chief’s professional opinion, such action is appropriate, safe and prudent.
4.
Agricultural burns by agricultural producers so long as the agricultural producer has obtained prior approval of the fire chief within whose jurisdiction the agricultural burn will take place or the sheriff.

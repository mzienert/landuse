CHAPTER 66: PERMITS AND PROCEDURES
Overview
This chapter describes the common procedures for
county
review of all land development activity in the
unincorporated
areas of La Plata County and the specific procedures for the review of
land use permits
and other types of applications.
The provisions common to all permit and
development
review covered in this chapter include, among other things, pre-application procedures, submittal requirements, public notice, scope of
county
review, public meetings and appeals.
This chapter also includes the unique procedural review requirements or steps for most individual types of
land use permit
applications and the rules that will apply to an application once it is approved, such as the life of the
development
approval, expiration, and amendments.
The specific procedural steps for divisions of land are in chapter 67 and for
planned unit developments
in chapter 68.
Sec. 66-13 Actions following decision-making official or body decisions
I.
Effect of approval or denial.
A.
Effect of approval and lapse. All approved plans, plats, and permits have a specified duration during which the applicant must take or complete some specific action.  Specific approval periods, including the specific actions that must be taken, are included in this code for each type of application.  See also code related provisions for statutory vested rights in subsection 66-13.III. below.  If the specified action is not taken within the prescribed period, the permit or approved plat/plan shall automatically lapse and be of no further force or effect.  If the permit or plat/plan has expired or lapsed, the applicant must reapply for and be granted a new permit or plat/plan approval to proceed with the project. Any development activity occurring under a lapsed permit, plat, or plan shall be subject to the enforcement and penalty provisions of chapter 80.
B.
Effect of denial limitation on successive applications. If the decision-making body denies an application, an application for that same request or a request that is substantially the same shall not be filed for a period of one (1) year from the date of denial, unless the denial explicitly states that an earlier re-application will be considered.  The applicant may submit a revised application that adequately addresses all of the decision-making body’s stated reasons for denial, however, at any time.  Such revised application shall be treated as a new application.
II.
Call-up procedures and appeals.
A.
All actions and decisions final unless appealed.  All actions and decisions made by a decision-making body shall become final unless called-up or appealed under the requirements stated in this section or state law.
B.
Call up procedures.

3.
Final action. A determination by the JPC on a new development application in the joint planning area, shall be deemed final after either:
a.
The expiration of the applicable call-up period where there was no request to call-up the application to the board; or
b.
If a call-up is requested, the board's final decision on the application, unless remanded to the JPC.
4.
Plat or agreement execution. After final action as defined by subparagraph 66-13.II.B.3. above, an associated plat or agreement shall be signed and dated by the chair of the board and attested by the clerk to the board, regardless of whether the development was called-up to the board.
C.
Appeals.
1.
Director determinations. Appeals from the type of director determinations set forth in subsection 66-4.I. shall follow the appeal procedure set forth in section 66-28 relating to the BOA.

III.
Vested rights.
A.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish a system of vested property rights for these land use regulations, as authorized by C.R.S. § 24-68-101
et seq.
B.
Establishment.
1.
General. A vested property right shall be deemed established for a land use permit with the approval of a site specific development plan. Such vested property right shall attach to and run with the land for which the land use permit is approved and shall confer upon the real property owner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of the real property under the terms and conditions of the site specific development plan for a period of three (3) years from the date of its approval.
2.
Site specific development plan. For the purposes of this section, site specific development plan shall only mean:
a.
Administrative land use permit: all developments except for special events;
b.
Minor land use permit: all developments except for temporary uses;
c.
Major land use permit: all developments except for sketch plans and preliminary plans and plats;
d.
Minor and major oil and gas permits, subject to paragraph 90-4.I.C.
C.
Duration and termination.
1.
Duration. A vested property right as defined by this section shall be deemed effective as of the date on which the decision-making body approves the site specific development plan and shall remain effective for a period of three (3) years. If upon expiration of the vesting period, the approved use has not commenced or the approved development has not been constructed, the approval shall be deemed expired. The three (3) year vesting period shall not be extended by amendments to a site specific development plan, unless expressly authorized by the board. Such approval shall be subject to all rights of judicial review; except the period permitted by law for the exercise of such rights shall not begin to run until the date of publication of a notice advising the general public of the approval. Publication shall be done by the CDD once in a newspaper of general circulation not more than fourteen (14) days after the date of final approval.
2.
Forfeiture. Failure to abide by any applicable terms and conditions attached to the site specific development plan shall result in immediate forfeiture of the vested property right.
3.
Extensions. The board may, as a legislative act, enter into a development agreement with a real property owner that provides that property rights shall be vested for a period exceeding three (3) years where it is warranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the size and phasing of the development, economic cycles and market conditions.
4.
Subsequent review and approval. Following approval or conditional approval of a site specific development plan, nothing in this section shall exempt the site specific development plan from subsequent reviews by the county to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, if such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the original approval.
D.
Exceptions. A vested property right, once established pursuant to this section precludes land use regulations adopted by the county for a three (3) year period of time from the date of approval of the site specific development plan, that would alter, impair, prevent, diminish or otherwise delay the development or use of the real property subject to the site specific development plan except:
1.
Property owner’s consent. With the consent of the affected real property owner.
2.
Hazards. Upon the discovery of natural hazards or human made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the subject property, which hazards could not reasonably have been discovered or did not exist at the time of the approval of the site specific development plan, and which hazards, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health and safety pursuant to section 81-2 Sections Necessary for Immediate Preservation of Public Health and Safety.
E.
Effect of expiration or termination on public lands. The expiration or termination of a vested property right shall have no effect upon publicly dedicated lands or rights-of-way dedicated with respect to such property.
IV.
Permit to be available for inspection.
Upon receipt of a land use permit required by this code, the holder of the permit shall keep a copy of the permit available for inspection, upon request, to be located on the subject site.

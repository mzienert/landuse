County
Water Right
No. 1, La Plata County Water Right No. 2, and La Plata County Water Right No. 3 decreed to the La Plata County by Division 7 water court case In re La Plata County, 06CW99 (filed December 20, 2006) in a manner that is consistent with the aforementioned court decree, the
County Code
, and state law. Transferring increments to
water users
shall not constitute a "sale" as that term is used in

land use permit
, a
building permit
, approval of a site specific development plan, or a vested property right pursuant to state statutes or common law.

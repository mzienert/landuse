Chapter 44. Impact Fees
Division 2: Road Impact Fees
Sec. 44-30 Inflation adjustment.
Beginning in 2025, at the end of each year during which a review and evaluation of the
road impact fee study
is not performed, the
road impact fee schedules
in Appendix A shall be adjusted by staff to account for construction cost inflation, pursuant to this section.  On January 1 following each calendar year during which the road impact fee schedule was not comprehensively updated based on an update of the road impact fee study, adjusted fee schedules shall become effective.  The
community development department
shall make the adjusted road impact fee schedules publicly available by updating Appendix A.  The community development department shall calculate adjustments to the main impact fee rates by multiplying them by a ratio, the numerator of which is the most recently available two-year moving average of the annual Colorado Construction Cost index prepared by the Colorado Department of Transportation and the denominator of which is the same index for a period one year earlier than the numerator.  If this index is discontinued or is unavailable, the Producer Price Index for Highway and Street Construction prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or National Highway Construction Cost Index by the Federal Highway Administration shall be used. The impact fee rates for residential additions shall then be adjusted accordingly to reflect the inflation updates in the main impact fee rates.

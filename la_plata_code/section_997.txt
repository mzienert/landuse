Sec. 64-1  Comprehensive plan
I.
Purpose of comprehensive plan.
A.
The
comprehensive plan
is intended to provide general policy guidance for decisions related to land use,
growth
and a number of related issues in the
unincorporated
area of the
county
. State law, more specifically C.R.S. § 30-28-106 requires counties to create and adopt a master plan/
comprehensive plan
.  The
comprehensive plan
is an advisory document adopted by the
planning commission
. It is a document against which certain
development
proposals should be evaluated in determining whether such proposals are in general conformance with the
county
’s goals, objectives and policies. The
comprehensive plan
is not binding unless the
board
, at its discretion, chooses to codify specific provisions into the land use code.  Nevertheless, the goals, objectives and policies contained in the
comprehensive plan
should be seriously considered when reviewing applicable
development
proposals, with the appropriate body exercising discretion in the application and balancing of the numerous goals and policies contained therein. The
comprehensive plan
also provides recommendations for possible future steps that could be taken to more fully implement the community’s vision or interests.
B.
The preparation of the
comprehensive plan
is intended to promote and protect the interest of the general public and present and future populations of the
county
. Moreover, the
comprehensive plan
establishes a framework to guide recommendations and decisions regarding future
development
, appropriate
use
of the land and its resources, needed facilities and services, protection of the environmental quality of the
county
, and a realistic strategy for realizing established visions, goals and policies.
C.
It is recognized that over time the
comprehensive plan
may need to be amended as community goals and factors affecting land use change. To ensure that the
comprehensive plan
is current with the community’s vision and the overall public interest, the
comprehensive plan
shall be reviewed, modified as appropriate, and adopted or readopted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
D.
The
comprehensive plan
and the associated
district plan
s are all intended to be adopted, interpreted, and applied in a harmonious fashion. No conflicts, direct or indirect, within such plans or between such plans, or the goals, objectives and policies therein, shall be considered to exist if there exists any reasonable interpretation that would allow all the provisions of such plans at issue to remain in effect.  If an ambiguity or conflict arises, the provisions of the
comprehensive plan
should be given more weight in consideration than a conflicting
district plan
.
II.
Adoption

PC
shall determine if revisions are needed because of changing conditions or circumstances, or modifications in the
county
's overall
development
and land
use
policies.
2.
The
PC
may initiate amendments to the
comprehensive plan
as a result of the update process or, as an alternative, may re-adopt the
comprehensive plan
in its existing form. Such re-adoptions or amendments shall be reviewed, and action taken using the same procedures for adopting and amending
comprehensive plan
s provided in this chapter. The failure to adopt or to re-adopt a
comprehensive plan
shall not affect the validity of previously adopted plans.
III.
Use
of comprehensive plan.
A.
​​​​​Although the board does not intend to codify the comprehensive plan, or any portion thereof, it is the intent of the board that development proposals consider advisory goals and policies contained in the comprehensive plan, and in any applicable district plans.
B.
A determination of general conformance with the comprehensive plan should be made by the decision-making body for any land use permit application in light of the facts and circumstances, evidence and considerations present in relation to that particular application. In this regard, a finding of general conformance with the comprehensive plan shall be based on a quasi-judicial weighting and balancing of various goals and policies in the comprehensive plan, district plans, and code. The decision-making body shall exercise its discretion based upon the factual considerations pertaining to the particular application.
C.
In reviewing a proposal, a wide array of community issues, goals, objectives and policies, as reflected in the comprehensive plan, may be considered or implicated. Thus, determining the proper balance to various comprehensive plan goals and polices, and the attribution of weight to such goals and policies for any particular proposal, is essential in determining if general conformity is achieved for that proposal. It is within the sound discretion of the decision-making body in this process to consider all such concerns, goals and policies in relation to the application, in its entirety, and to give each the weight it deserves based upon the circumstances presented to the decision-making body. Therefore, the decision-making body may determine the proper balance of impacts, goals and policies in ascertaining if proper conformity with such comprehensive plan, in general, is desirable or has been attained.
D.
In rendering a decision on a proposal, the decision-making body should reference relevant portions of the comprehensive plan considered. Such comprehensive plan provisions should support the basis for the decision-making body’s reasoning and decision regarding the proposal, particularly in relation to a determination on general conformity with the comprehensive plan.

Sec. 64-3 District plans
I.
Purpose of district plans.
A.
District plans
are intended to provide more detailed guidelines and specific direction for individual planning districts than is contained in the
comprehensive plan
. District plans recognize that each planning district has a distinct character. Such district plans shall apply to the entire area within the planning district and may address those issues as set forth in this section. Like the comprehensive plan, district plans shall be advisory in nature.
B.
District plans are intended to set more specific development guidelines and direction or otherwise may create a higher degree of specificity on the development of property. District plans shall not be deemed to be in direct or indirect conflict with the comprehensive plan merely because they may recommend more specific conditions or limitations on development, including density.
II.
Contents of district plans.
District plans may include the following issues unique to the area, at the discretion of the
planning commission
:
A.
Goals, policies and actions related to area specific issues that are not already addressed in the comprehensive plan.
B.
District maps or other demonstrative materials.
C.
Implementation strategies to enact the goals, policies and actions set forth in the comprehensive plan.
D.
Unique or specific quasi-public facility, institutional use or infrastructure issues.
E.
Identification of appropriate locations for a diversity of employee or affordable housing and permanent resident housing types.
F.
Identification of needs and appropriate locations for different types of dispersed and developed recreational uses or new recreational facilities.
G.
Infill, redevelopment, rehabilitation or adaptive reuse of properties.
H.
Within the context of the content of the comprehensive plan and C.R.S. § 30-28-106, any other considerations related to issues of development or growth in the relevant planning district.
III.
Contents not to be included in district plans.
District plans typically should not include the following:
A.
Goals, policies and actions that address issues that are countywide (and not planning district specific) in nature and are similar in intent to goals, policies and actions already addressed in the comprehensive plan. This limitation shall be interpreted narrowly to only address policies that are directly redundant with the comprehensive plan.
B.
Goals, objectives or policies that can only be interpreted to unavoidably and directly conflict with the comprehensive plan. If the comprehensive plan and a district plan can reasonably be construed to be consistent, that interpretation is favored. Where there exists a conflict or overlap between provisions, the provisions of the comprehensive plan shall prevail. District plan policies that serve to set more specific development guidelines, which may include a higher degree of specificity on the development of property, including the density related thereto, shall not be considered to directly conflict.
IV.
Adoption and amendment of district plans.
Adoption of, and amendments to, district plans shall be subject to the same procedures and criteria in section 64-1-governing the comprehensive plan; provided, however that prior to the public hearing on consideration of adoption of, or an amendment to, a district plan, a
RDAC
for the district, if any, shall have the opportunity to make recommendations to the
PC
on the content of the district plan and provide comment on the findings necessary for amendment of the district plan.
V.
Updates to district plans.
District plans adopted by the PC shall be updated by the PC on a periodic basis. The PC shall determine if revisions are needed because of changing conditions or circumstances, or modifications in the county's overall development policies or the policies within the planning district. Amendments or re-adoption of a district plan as a result of an update shall be processed in the same manner as any adoption of, or amendment to, a district plan according to this chapter. The failure to adopt or to re-adopt a district plan shall not affect the validity of previously adopted plans.
VI.
Use of district plans.
A.
As with the comprehensive plan, the board does not intend to codify the district plans, or any portions thereof. It is the intent of the board that development proposals consider the advisory goals and policies contained in any applicable district plan.
B.
A determination of general conformance with the applicable district plan should be made by the decision-making body for any land use permit application in light of the facts and circumstances, evidence and considerations present in relation to that particular application. In this regard, a finding of general conformance with an applicable district plan shall be based on a quasi-judicial weighting and balancing of various goals and policies in the district plan and code. The decision-making body shall exercise its discretion based upon the factual considerations pertaining to the application.
C.
In reviewing a proposal, a wide array of community issues, goals, objectives and policies, as reflected in the applicable district plan, may be considered or implicated. Thus, determining the proper balance to various district plan goals and polices, and the attribution of weight to such goals and policies for any particular proposal, is essential in determining if general conformity is achieved for that proposal. It is within the sound discretion of the decision-making body in this process to consider all such concerns, goals and policies in relation to the application, in its entirety, and to give each the weight it deserves based upon the circumstances presented to the decision-making body. Therefore, the decision-making body may determine the proper balance of impacts, goals and policies in ascertaining if proper conformity with such district plan, in general, is desirable or has been attained.
D.
In rendering a decision on a proposal, the decision-making body should reference relevant portions of the district plan considered. Such district plan provisions should support the basis for the decision-making body’s reasoning and decision regarding the proposal, particularly in relation to a determination on general conformity with the applicable district plan.

Sec. 64-4 District maps
I.
District maps.
The boundaries of the
planning districts
are shown on the map entitled Official Development District Map of La Plata County, Colorado. District maps are intended to be part of the
district plans
and shall show the boundaries of each planning district. District maps are not intended to reflect zoning of any area of the planning district but may reflect land uses which are consistent with the contents of the district plan. All district plan maps are kept and maintained by the county GIS Department and available as layers in the county’s publicly accessible internet mapping system.
II.
Adoption, amendments or updates of district maps.
District maps may be adopted, amended or updated in the same manner as a district plan.

Sec. 64-5 Intergovernmental cooperation
I.
Cooperative planning activities.
The county benefits from having strong and cooperative relationships with municipalities within the county. To that end, when appropriate, the county should consult and cooperate with the planning commissions of incorporated municipalities within the county in order to coordinate mutually beneficial growth and development.
II.
Municipal 3-mile and comprehensive plans.
The
planning commission
shall review any 3-mile and/or
comprehensive plans
adopted by an incorporated municipality to ensure compatibility with the county’s comprehensive plan and applicable
district plan
in that area. In addition, the county should make every effort to refer a land use permit application to a municipality when the proposed land use or development is located within that municipality’s 3-mile plan.
III.
Intergovernmental agreements.
The county may at any time enter into an intergovernmental agreement with municipalities to address joint planning issues, including but not limited to:
joint planning areas
,
urban growth
boundaries, urban renewal areas and annexation procedures. Within the Durango District and La Posta Area District, the applicable land uses and development standards and land use review procedures shall be those standards and procedures enumerated and referenced in the Intergovernmental Agreement Regarding Joint Land Use Planning between the county and the City of Durango, section 72-2 and other applicable provisions of this code.

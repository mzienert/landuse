Chapter 79 Nonconformities
Sec. 79-2 Authority to continue
Nonconformities shall be allowed to continue only if complying with the provisions of this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to require a change in plans, construction or use of any real property, development, structure or sign for which a building permit, land use permit or other development approval was lawfully obtained from the county prior to the effective date or amendment of this code, provided the development, construction or use is commenced and completed according to the applicable permit or approval terms. Changes of ownership, tenancy or management of an existing nonconformity are allowed, and in such case, the nonconforming situation shall continue to be subject to the standards of this chapter. The owner, and not the county, has the burden of establishing that a nonconformity exists.

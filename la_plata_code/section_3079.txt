Chapter 68 Planned Unit Developments
Sec. 68-2 Applicability
This chapter applies to applications to designate a new PUD and, subject to section 68-8 below, PUDs existing prior to the effective date of this code. A PUD designation is primarily intended for use on a parcel or parcels of property that consists of a minimum of ten (10) acres. An applicant may request a PUD designation for a parcel that consists of less than ten (10) acres if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the PC during PUD sketch plan review that the proposed development would not negatively affect surrounding uses and the PUD would result in a greater benefit to the community than would development under conventional methods. A PUD designation should not be granted solely to permit variances for development of a single lot, building or use.
No PUD may be approved without the written consent of all owners whose properties are included within the PUD.
If a PUD consists of individual lots, subdivision plat or exemption plat approval shall also be required.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in an approved PUD guide, all development of real property pertaining to a PUD shall conform with this code. If the PUD guide is silent concerning a standard, restriction or requirement but this code is not, this code shall control. If the PUD guide conflicts with this code, the PUD guide shall control.

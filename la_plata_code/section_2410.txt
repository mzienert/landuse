authorizes the building official to enter areas of the subject building or structure, or its premises, to enforce Code provisions related to that permit, including the performance of any inspection provided for in section
18-35
(110) of this Code. Initial inspections shall be at the request of the
permittee
but, if the building official determines any follow-up or additional inspections are necessary, such follow-up or additional inspections may be conducted without notice to the permittee.
2. Non-permitted Premises.
Where a building or structure is not subject to an active building permit, but the building official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in the building or structure, or upon its premises, a condition which is contrary to or in
violation
of this Code and which makes the building, structure, or premises unsafe, dangerous, or hazardous, the building official is authorized to enter the building, structure, or premises at reasonable times to inspect or otherwise perform the duties imposed by this Code, provided that if such building, structure, or premises is occupied, credentials shall be presented to the occupant(s) and entry requested. If such building, structure, or premises is unoccupied, the building official shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the
owner
or other person having charge or
control
of the building, structure, or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, or if the owner or person in charge of an unoccupied structure does not respond to the building official’s reasonable efforts to locate him or her, then the building official and his or her agents or employees may make recourse to any remedy provided by local, state, or federal law or regulation to secure entry to the building, structure, or premises.

equipment
, and design. Materials, equipment, and devices approved by the building official shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval, the manufacturer’s instructions, and the safety requirements of this Code. The provisions of this Code are not intended to prevent the installation of any material or to prohibit any design or method of construction not specifically prescribed by this Code, provided any such alternative has been approved by the building official.  An alternative material, design or method of construction for a specific permit may be approved on a case by case basis where the building official finds that the proposed design or material is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the applicable provisions of this Code. Used materials, equipment, and devices may be used upon approval of the building official when sufficient documentation or information — as determined by the building official in the exercise of his or her discretion — is provided to demonstrate that their
use
will comply with the safety requirements of this Code.
104.10 Modifications. Whenever the building official determines, in the exercise of his or her discretion, that circumstances specific to a building, structure, or premises render compliance with and/or enforcement of any provision of this Code
impracticable
, the building official shall have the authority to consider and
grant
an application for modification of this Code’s provisions as to an individual building or structure. Before granting any such application for modification, the building official shall determine that the specific circumstances cited in the application render code compliance and/or enforcement impracticable, and that the modification requested will not materially lessen or weaken this Code’s requirements concerning health, accessibility, life and fire safety, or structural requirements. The details granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the files of the Building Department pursuant to section 104.7.
104.11. Tests. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the provisions of this Code or any other applicable law, or evidence that any material, equipment, design, or other construction method does not conform to the requirements of this Code or any other applicable law, or to substantiate claims for alternative materials or methods, the building official shall have the authority, at the expense of the applicant, to require expert opinions or tests as evidence of compliance.
Standards
and methods for any required expert opinions or tests shall be as specified in this Code or as required by the building official in the exercise of his or her discretion.  Where applicable, expert opinions or tests shall be procured from an approved agency and/or design professional.

18-35
(107.2).
10. Expansive soils. When it is found that a building site is located in an area of the County where the soils are classified as being highly expansive, or technical evidence and soil characteristics indicate highly expansive soils, the foundation system for all residential structures must be designed by a
professional engineer
, licensed by the State of Colorado.  The design of the foundation system will address the expansion or
adverse
soil conditions at the site. The classification of soils will be based on the “soil survey of La Plata County area, Colorado” provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture – Soil Conservation 1981-82, and the maps on the La Plata County GIS Mapping System.
11. Geologic hazards. When the building site is located in an area subject to geologic hazards, the building official may require an engineering geologist or other
engineer
working within their field of expertise to submit specific recommendations for site development to address site drainage and defensive techniques that will limit
impacts
of the geologic hazards.  This requirement applies only to residential and
commercial
buildings and structures.
12. Flood plain development.  All development within the mapped flood
hazard
zones of La Plata County must comply with Res. No. 2014-30 (August 5, 2014) or subsequent flood plain management regulations adopted by La Plata County, including, but not limited to, Chapter 78 of the La Plata County Code of Resolutions and Ordinances.

FEMA
elevation certificate will be required along with other engineering requirements contained in the regulations.
13. Computations and
specifications
verifying compliance with the energy efficiency requirements set forth in this Code at section
18-45
.
An application shall be deemed complete if it is submitted in the required form and includes all required submittal information and is accompanied by the applicable fee.  In addition, an application will be considered complete only if the building official determines the information contained in the submittal is adequate to enable the building official to ultimately determine whether the proposed
project
will comply with this Code.
105.4 Time limitation of application. A permit application on which no permit has issued shall be deemed to have been
abandoned
180 days after the date of the application’s filing, unless such application has been pursued in
good faith
. The building official is authorized, in the exercise of his or her discretion, to grant one extension of time, not exceeding 180 days, to allow the applicant to pursue his or her application.  The extension shall be requested in writing with a demonstration that circumstances beyond the applicant’s control previously have prevented the applicant from pursuing the application in good faith. If no extension is granted, no further processing of an abandoned application shall occur, and the application shall be considered automatically withdrawn.  Any plans submitted with the application shall be either returned to the applicant or destroyed by the building official. Any re-submittal of the application thereafter by the applicant will be treated as a new application for purposes of review, scheduling, and payment of application fees.
105.5 Action on application. The building official shall examine or cause to be examined applications for permits and amendments thereto within a reasonable time after filing. If the application or any of its attachments do not conform to the requirements of this Code, pertinent laws, or County regulations, the building official shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the building official is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this Code, and any laws and ordinances applicable thereto, the building official shall issue a permit as soon as practicable. When the building official issues a permit, all construction documents shall be stamped “approved.” Field inspections may warrant changes or corrections to meet Code requirements.
105.6 Validity of permit. The issuance or granting of a permit shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any
violation
of any provision of this Code or of any other applicable law or regulation. Any language in an issued permit contrary to or in conflict with the provisions of this Code shall be invalid. The issuance of a permit based on construction documents and other data shall not prevent the building official from later requiring the correction of errors in the construction documents and other data. The building official may prohibit occupancy or use of a building or structure determined to be in violation of this Code or of any other applicable law or regulation.
105.7 Lapsed or Abandoned Permits.
105.7.1 Lapse. Every permit issued shall lapse and be of no further force or effect unless the work on the site is commenced within 12 months after the permit’s issuance.  If the permit has lapsed, the applicant must reapply for and be granted a renewal (pursuant to subsection 105.8 below) or a new permit to proceed with the project.  Any activity occurring under a lapsed permit may be subject to an investigation fee as provided in section
18-35
(109.3) of this Code.
105.7.2
Abandonment
. If the work authorized on the site by a permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 12 months after the date on which work was commenced, the permit will be considered abandoned and be of no further force and effect.  If the permit is abandoned, the applicant must reapply for and be granted a renewal (pursuant to subsection 105.8 below) or a new permit to proceed with the project.  Any activity occurring under an abandoned permit may be subject to an investigation fee as provided in section

Section 111 Occupancy Approvals
111.1
Use
and occupancy. No
building
or
structure
, or portion thereof, requiring a
permit
in accordance with section
18-35
(105) of this
Code
, shall be used or occupied, and no change in the existing occupancy classification of such building or structure, or portion thereof, shall be made, until the
building official
has issued an appropriate certificate authorizing the legal occupancy of the building  or structure.
111.1.1
New construction
Certificate of Occupancy.  Following issuance of a
building permit
, compliance with all required inspections, compliance with the International
Fire Code
as adopted and amended by Chapter 34 of the La Plata
County
Code, and completion of the final inspection described above in section
18-35
(110.2.8), the building official may issue a certificate of occupancy. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy will verify that
construction
work has been completed in accordance with permitted
plans
and necessary inspections were completed. The certificate will serve as written notification from the building official to the property
owner
that the work covered under the permit is complete and the permit is closed.
EXCEPTION: Single occupancies of Group U used solely for
agriculture
buildings, barns, carports, garages,
livestock
shelters, private garages, sheds, or stables are exempt from the certificate of occupancy requirements.  Group U occupancies with
residential
uses must receive a certificate of occupancy.
111.1.2 Certificate of Temporary Occupancy. The building official is authorized, at his or her discretion, to issue a certificate of temporary occupancy before the completion of the entire work covered by the permit, provided that the building official determines that the completed portions can be occupied safely. The certificate of temporary occupancy shall expire on a date certain, as stated on the certificate.
The building official may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for residential (R-3) occupancies when the structure is substantially completed, but not completed to a point that a final inspection can be performed. The
permittee
must have obtained final approvals for the
sewage
disposal system, installation of safety features, fire separations between living areas and attached garages, and either the completion of the plumbing system within the home or the isolation of fixtures that are not yet installed before a certificate of temporary occupancy may issue.
The failure to obtain a certificate of occupancy before the expiration of the certificate of temporary occupancy shall be a
violation
of this Code. The building official shall notify the permittee of such violation in writing and the notice of violation shall be retained in the records of the Building
Department
. The building official, at his or her discretion, may use all legal enforcement remedies to halt the use and occupancy of the building or structure.
111.1.3 Certificate of Limited Compliance. The building official may issue a permittee a certificate of limited compliance in lieu of a certificate of occupancy when any of the following circumstances exist, but the building official nevertheless determines that occupancy of the building or structure does not pose a risk to health or safety:
1. Failure to complete required inspections. A permittee, or any of the permittee's
agents
, fails to complete any inspection required by section
18-35
(110). The certificate of limited compliance shall list those inspections which must be completed to obtain a certificate of occupancy.
2. Construction without a building permit. A
project
is constructed without issuance of a building permit, such that any inspection required by section
18-35
(110) cannot be completed. The certificate of limited compliance shall list those inspections which must be completed to obtain a certificate of occupancy, as well as any other instances in which full compliance with this Code was not achieved.
3. Construction not in accordance with approved plans. A permitted project is not completed according to the plans which the Building Department has approved pursuant to section
18-35
(106). A project will be considered to be not in accordance with approved plans in circumstances including, but not limited to, where the approved plans provide that a portion of the project will remain unfinished, but the permittee finishes that portion; or where the approved plans provide that a portion of the project will be finished, but that portion remains unfinished. The certificate of limited compliance shall identify those portions of the project not completed in accordance with the approved plans.
Issuance of a certificate of limited compliance will close the building permit. To obtain a certificate of occupancy, the permittee, the permittee's agents, or the permittee's successors in interest must apply for and obtain a new building permit authorizing the completion or correction of all items which the certificate of limited compliance identifies as outstanding or non-compliant.
111.1.4 Remodel,
additions

Sec. 90-15 Insurance
Each operator shall comply with these insurance standards to protect human health and safety, prevent damage to property, prevent unacceptable losses to public finances and prevent unreasonable interference with the public welfare. The director, with notice and consent of the county finance director and risk manager, may waive or alter requirements below if the operator can demonstrate that required coverage is not commercially available or not relevant to the operations proposed in the application. Where an operator owns, holds or controls fifty (50) percent or more of another operator doing business within the county, the parent company operator may fulfill the obligations of this section for itself and its subsidiary operator companies, provided the policy(ies) name both the parent and the subsidiary operator companies and provide coverage in the required amounts for each entity the parent operator seeks to cover. Operators shall maintain or cause to be maintained the following types of insurance with insurers authorized by the state of Colorado and carrying a financial strength rating from A.M. Best of no less than A-VII (or similar rating from an equivalent recognized rating agency):
I.
Commercial general liability insurance.
Operator will maintain general liability coverage for property damage, bodily injury to third parties and sudden or accidental pollution that requires remediation with no exclusion for claims arising from operator-caused seismicity from oil and gas wells, in the minimum amount of five million (5,000,000) dollars per occurrence.  The coverage required by this section may be secured alone or in combination with an umbrella or excess policy.  The county shall be named as a “certificate holder” and “scheduled person or organization” so the county receives advance notice of cancellation.  Operators shall be responsible for any damage or loss suffered by the county because of noncompliance by the operator or any subcontractor with this section or the code.
II.
Cancellation; non-renewal.
All policies shall be endorsed such that they cannot be cancelled or non-renewed without at least thirty (30) days advance written notice to the operator and the county, evidenced by receipt, except when such policy is being cancelled for nonpayment of a premium in which case ten (10) days advance written notice is required. Language relating to cancellation requirements stating that the insurer’s notice obligation is limited to “endeavor to” is not acceptable.
III.
Right of contribution.
Operator shall ensure that each of the policies is endorsed to provide they are primary without right of contribution from the county or any insurance or self-insurance issued to the county.
IV.
Lapses.
In the event an operator’s coverage lapses, is canceled, or otherwise not in force, in addition to any other remedy set forth in chapter 80 or section 90-18, the county reserves the right to obtain the insurance required by this chapter and charge all costs and associated expenses to operator, which shall become due and payable immediately.

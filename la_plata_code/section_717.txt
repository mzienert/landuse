DIVISION 1. GENERALLY
Sec. 46-33. Penalty assessment procedure.
Any peace officer within the
county
is specifically authorized to follow the penalty assessment procedure as set forth in C.R.S. § 16-2-201 with regard to the
violations
of any provision of this article.
The arresting officer
may
either give the
person
a penalty assessment notice and release him upon its terms, or take him before a judge of the county court.
The penalty assessment notice
shall
be a summons and complaint containing identification of the alleged offender, specification of the offense and applicable fine, a requirement that the alleged offender pay the fine or appear to answer the charge at a specified time and place, and any other matter reasonably adapted to effectuating the purposes of this article. A duplicate copy shall be sent to the clerk of the county court.
If the person given a penalty assessment notice chooses to acknowledge his guilt, he may pay the specified fine in person or by mail at the place and within the time specified in the notice. If he chooses not to acknowledge his guilt, he shall appear as required in the notice. Upon trial, if the alleged offender is found guilty, the fine imposed shall be that specified in the notice for the offense to which he was found guilty, but customary court costs may be assessed against him in
addition
to the fine.

I.
The
flood
hazard areas of the
county
are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
II.
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood-proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.

Sec. 78-18. Statement of purpose.
The intent and purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
I.
Protect human life and health;
II.
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control
projects
;

Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
IV.
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
V.
Minimize damage to
critical facilities
, infrastructure and other public
facilities
such as water, sewer and gas mains; electric and communications stations; and streets and bridges located in
floodplains
;
VI.
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound
use
and
development
of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
VII.
Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is located in a flood hazard area.

Sec. 78-19. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
I.
Restricting or prohibiting uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of
flood
, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
II.
Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including
facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction
;
III.
Controlling the alteration of natural
floodplains
, stream
channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
IV.
Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other
development
which
may
increase flood damage; and
V.
Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.

DIVISION 3. WEED MANAGEMENT PLAN
Sec.58-103 Introduction
The Colorado Noxious Weed Act (CRS 35-5.5-101, et. seq.) is designed to ensure that all the lands of the State of Colorado, whether in public or private ownership, be protected by and subject to the jurisdiction of a local government empowered to manage undesirable plants as designated by the State of Colorado and the local governing body. Certain undesirable plants constitute a present threat to the continued economic and environmental value of the lands of the State and if present in any area of the State, must be managed.
This Weed Management Plan represents a coordinated effort of the La Plata County Weed Office (Weed Office) and the La Plata County Undesirable Plant and Rodent Advisory Commission (Advisory Commission) to develop and oversee a comprehensive management plan for the control of noxious weeds in La Plata County. The Advisory Commission will review the plan at regular intervals as set forth in Section 58-35 of the La Plata County code.
This plan further recognizes that because the spread of noxious weeds can largely be attributed to the movement of seed and plant parts on motor vehicles, noxious weeds are becoming an increasing maintenance problem on highway right-of-ways in the state. As a result, local cooperative efforts have been undertaken to proceed with noxious weed management. The plan also recognizes that the changes brought about by extended drought due to climate changes will stress native plant life and weed infestation issues will continue to increase.
This plan is designed in accordance with the statutory provisions of the Colorado Noxious Weed Act. The provisions of this plan do not interpret, apply, or incorporate any provisions of the Colorado Pest Control District Act, codified at C.R.S. § 35-5-101, et seq.

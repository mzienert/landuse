Chapter 67 Division of Land
Sec. 67-15 Subdivision Standards
I.
Development standards.
A.
Applicable standards. Unless otherwise provided in this code, all subdivision development pursuant to chapter 67 shall be subject to standards within this chapter 67, chapter 70: general site development standards applicable to all developments, chapter 72: supplemental overlay standards and chapter 74: roads, bridges and driveways.
B.
Completion of improvements or performance guarantee. For all approved subdivisions that include required improvements, prior to the recording of the final plat, the applicant shall provide certification of completion of all improvements and inspections as outlined in 66-30.II.D and E, or execute a development improvements agreement and submit a performance guarantee according to the procedures and standards outlined in section 66-30.
C.
Improvements maintenance. A homeowners' association or other legal entity or mechanism shall be created as the mechanism by which all improvements will be maintained without expense to the county. These improvements include, but are not limited to: roads, water and sewer systems, streetlights and signs, fences and weed control methods. Such private improvement maintenance agreements shall be recorded in the official records of the county clerk and recorder and referenced in the plat notices including the reception number of the recorded document.
II.
Naming of subdivisions, street and addressing.
A.
Applicability. Notwithstanding any applicable section in this code, this subsection II on naming applies to applications for all land use permits and any owner who seeks to change an existing name.
B.
Standards.
1.
Proposed subdivision names shall not duplicate existing subdivision names within the county. Nor shall subdivision names be the reversal or variation of an existing name that, in the opinion of the director, may unnecessarily contribute to confusion for emergency responders.
2.
Naming of streets and addressing. Consistent and appropriate street naming and addressing procedures and standards contribute to the planned and orderly development of the county in a way that assists first responders in maintaining the public health, safety and general welfare of persons within the county. Any person who creates a new street, wants to name or re-name an existing street or requests the assignment of a new or revised address shall meet the minimum standards set forth in the naming and addressing policy and guidance documents made available by the La Plata County GIS Department, which policy and guidance documents are intended to implement these standards and which may be amended by such department to comport to current industry standards.
III.
Lot design and density standards.
A.
Topography. To the maximum extent practicable, all lots shall be designed to conform to the existing topography in such a way as to avoid future problems or conflicts with access, drainage or utility service, as well as to preserve existing natural features such as unusual rock formations and bodies of water.
B.
Shape. Lots shall have a depth to width ratio of no greater than four (4) to one (1), or minimum buildable area of no greater than three (3) to one (1). Depth and width shall be calculated using the average width and depth for the lot.
C.
Layout.
1.
A single lot shall not be divided by a public or private road, alley or another lot; unless the director determines that the lot layout protects the natural features of the site or creates additional open space.
2.
Side lot lines should be at approximate right angles or radial to the road right-of-way or centerline.
3.
Each lot shall have access to a private street, a private access easement or right-of-way, or a dedicated street.
4.
Through lots shall be avoided, except where necessary to buffer residential development from conflicting uses, or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography.
5.
Wedge shape lots shall not be less than twenty-five (25) feet in width at the property line through which access occurs, or from the road easement if the property line extends into the easement.
6.
No single lot shall be divided by a municipal, county or state boundary line.
D.
Sufficient buildable area. All lots shall have sufficient buildable area to accommodate the planned structures and shall have driveway access in compliance with chapter 74; however, buildable areas need not be shown as a designated building envelope on the plat unless needed for mitigation pursuant to paragraph E below.
E.
Designated building envelopes to mitigate impacts. In general, building envelopes designated on plats should only be used when necessary to achieve a guideline or standard. Building envelopes may be utilized to mitigate adverse impacts to surrounding properties pursuant to a compatibility assessment and to avoid or accommodate critical lands such as rivers, wetlands, floodways, steep slopes and geologic hazards and to accommodate clustering. Building envelopes established on plats shall be accompanied by a plat notice describing the use and development limitations or allowances within both the building envelope and the area of the lot outside of the building envelope.
F.
Lot size and density review. The applicant shall propose the density and sizes of the lots intended for the development. The advisory and decision-making bodies shall review the adequacy of the lot sizes and appropriateness of the density proposed using the required standards outlined in this paragraph F. If the advisory or decision-making body finds that proposed lot sizes or density do not meet standards in this section, they shall request alternative lot sizes, numbers of lots or both. The permit application shall be denied or continued until the appropriate lot sizes and density are proposed by the applicant. Unless otherwise provided in this code, the minimum lot size shall be determined by the following criteria:
1.
Minimum lot sizes and dimensions shall exclude street/and or road rights-of-way.
2.
Minimum lot sizes may be achieved by counting a prorated share of open space owned in common by all lot owners within the subject subdivision. For example, if the development qualifies for minimum ten thousand (10,000) square foot lots, and two thousand (2,000) square feet of lot area for each lot is included in an open space owned in common by all lot owners, then the minimum lot size may be reduced to eight thousand (8,000) square feet.
3.
The minimum lot size shall be three (3) acres if the lot is to be served by individual groundwater well and on-site wastewater treatment systems.
4.
The minimum lot size shall be one (1) acre if the lot is to be served by a central water or sewer system, but not both.
5.
The minimum lot size shall be ten thousand (10,000) square feet if the lot is served by a central water and sewer system.
6.
Lots for multi-family dwellings, townhome dwellings and commercial development may be less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet if the lot is served by a central water and sewer system.
7.
Regardless of the minimum lot sizes provided in subparagraphs 3 to 6 above, the appropriate minimum lot sizes and density shall also be reviewed and determined based on the following:
a.
A compatibility assessment pursuant to section 70-5;
b.
In the Animas Valley Land Use Plan, the minimum lot sizes and density shall meet the applicable district requirements of chapter 65;
c.
Development shall function on one (1) lot. The development shall function efficiently and safely without overcrowding, given the lot's topography, location, hazards and the development's:
i.
Utilities;
ii.
Vehicular, pedestrian and emergency access;
iii.
Parking;
iv.
Individual sewage disposal systems;
v.

Easements of not less than ten (10) feet in width for water, sewer, power and telephone shall be provided along at least two (2) property lines for each lot. Where additional easements or wider easements are required to serve the needs of one (1) or more utility providers, the director shall determine the appropriate easement specifications after consultation with utility providers. Alternatively, the applicant can demonstrate to the director’s satisfaction that fewer or narrower easements are appropriate based on site specific circumstances.
B.
Drainage easements of sufficient size and width shall be provided to protect streams, drainage ways of historical use, and the new drainage system and facilities that are part of the approved drainage plan.
C.
All easements shall be shown graphically on the plat, fully dimensioned and include the applicable dedication certificate pursuant to paragraph 67-15.VI.D.
V.
